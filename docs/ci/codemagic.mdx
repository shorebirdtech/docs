# Codemagic Workflow Integration

This guide will help you integrate Shorebird into your Codemagic Workflow using the [Codemagic YAML](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

## Prerequisites

✅ Shorebird CLI is installed on your machine

✅ You are logged into a Shorebird account.

:::info
Refer to the [getting started](/) instructions for more information.
:::

## Authentication

Most Shorebird functionality, like creating releases and patches, requires being authenticated. In order to authenticate with Shorebird in CI, you will need to generate a CI token.

```sh
shorebird login:ci
```

You will be prompted to go through a similar OAuth Flow as when using `shorebird login`, however, `shorebird login:ci` will not store any credentials on your device. Instead, a Shorebird token will be generated for you to use in CI.

The output should look something like:

```sh
$ shorebird login:ci
The Shorebird CLI needs your authorization to manage apps, releases, and patches on your behalf.

In a browser, visit this URL to log in:

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth...

Waiting for your authorization...

🎉 Success! Use the following token to login on a CI server:

<SHOREBIRD_TOKEN>

Example:

export SHOREBIRD_TOKEN="$SHOREBIRD_TOKEN" && shorebird patch android
```

:::caution
The `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` is a secret and should not be committed directly in your source code or shared publicly.
:::

Next, copy the generated `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` and navigate to your Codemagic
secrets via:

1. Go to "Environment Variables"
2. Enter `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` as variable name
3. Paste the token into the variable value field
4. Select or create new group, such as "shorebird"
5. Ensure "Secure" is checked

We recommend using the variable name `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` as it's the default name
used by the Shorebird CLI. If you choose a different name, you'll need to set
the `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` environment variable in your Codemagic workflow manually.

## Codemagic Workflow Editor

Unfortunately, the Codemagic Workflow Editor doesn't support changing the build
command. As a result, you will need to use the [Codemagic YAML](#codemagic-yaml)
file to integrate Shorebird into your workflow.

## Codemagic YAML

If you don't know how to use the Codemagic YAML, please refer to the [Codemagic
YAML documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

In the `codemagic.yaml` file, specify the `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` under `environment`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maclinux" label="Mac/Linux" default>

1. Add the group "shorebird" to your environment groups. If you're using a
   different group name, use that instead.

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
```

2. Add a script to your workflow to set up Shorebird. This script will install
   Shorebird and add it to your PATH.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: 🐦 Setup Shorebird
    script: |
      # Install Shorebird
      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

      # Add Shorebird to PATH
      echo PATH="/Users/builder/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
```

3. Execute Shorebird commands in your workflow.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: 🚀 Shorebird Patch
    script: shorebird patch android --force
```

### Full Example

Here's an example of a complete `codemagic.yaml` file:

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      groups:
        - shorebird
      flutter: stable
    scripts:
      - name: 🐦 Setup Shorebird
        script: |
          # Install Shorebird
          curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

          # Add Shorebird to PATH
          echo PATH="/Users/builder/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
      - name: 🚀 Shorebird Patch
        script: shorebird patch android --force
```

You can find a working example in this repository:
[codemagic-shorebird-demo](https://github.com/nilsreichardt/codemagic-shorebird-demo)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
The documentation for Windows is under development and will be available soon.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Example

If you want to specify the operation type (patch or release) externally, you can
use environment variables in your workflow.

```yaml
workflows:
  advanced-example:
    name: Advanced Example
    environment:
      vars:
        TYPE: 'patch' # Can be 'patch' or 'release'
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
      flutter: stable
    scripts:
      - name: 🐦 Setup Shorebird
        script: |
          # Install Shorebird
          curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

          # Add Shorebird to PATH
          echo PATH="/Users/builder/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
      - name: 🙌 Shorebird Build
        script: |
          echo "➡️ Using type: $TYPE"

          # If type is neither "patch" nor "release", exit with error
          if [ "$TYPE" != "patch" ] && [ "$TYPE" != "release" ]; then
            echo "TYPE must be either 'patch' or 'release'"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check type and run corresponding command
          if [ "$TYPE" == "patch" ]; then
            echo "🩹 Running patch command"
            shorebird patch android --force
          elif [ "$TYPE" == "release" ]; then
            echo "🚀 Running release command"
            shorebird release android --force
          fi
```

Now, you can execute the workflow, as shown below:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.codemagic.io/builds' \
--header 'x-auth-token: YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "appId": "YOUR-APP-ID",
    "workflowId": "advanced-example",
    "branch": "main",
    "environment": {
        "variables": {
            "TYPE": "release"
        }
    }
}'
```

This command will run the release command. If you want to run the patch command,
change the `TYPE` variable to `patch`.

To obtain your `x-auth-token`, please follow the [Codemagic API authentication
docs](https://docs.codemagic.io/rest-api/codemagic-rest-api/#authentication).
