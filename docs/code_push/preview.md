# Preview

Once you have [created a release](/code_push/release), you can preview your
release on an Android device, Android emulator, or iOS device using the `shorebird preview` command.

```sh
shorebird preview
```

This will download the release artifacts for the selected app release version, install the app on the selected device, and start the application.
