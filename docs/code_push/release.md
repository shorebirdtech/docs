# Publish a Release

In order to start pushing updates, you will need to create a release using `shorebird release`.

```
shorebird release
```

Creating a release builds and submits your app to Shorebird. Shorebird saves the compiled Dart code from your application in order to make updates smaller in size.

```
$ shorebird release
