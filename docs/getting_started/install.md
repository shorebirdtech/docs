# Installing Shorebird

To install the Shorebird CLI use the following script:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | sh
```

:::info
Installing Shorebird CLI requires having `git` installed and currently only supports Mac and Linux hosts.
:::

This installs shorebird into `~/.shorebird/bin` and adds it to your `PATH`. It also installs a copy of Flutter and Dart inside `~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`. These versions are not intended to be used for development (yet). You can continue to use the versions of Flutter and Dart you already have installed.

:::info
The total installation is about 300mb.
:::

Once the installation has completed, you should have the `shorebird` command available:

```
$ shorebird
