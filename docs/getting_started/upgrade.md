# Upgrade your Account

Once you have a Shorebird account, you need to upgrade to a paid account in order to access to Shorebird services.

The cost is $20 USD per user per month. There is currently no limit on the number of apps you can release or update.

To upgrade your account's subscription, use the `shorebird account upgrade` command:

```
shorebird account upgrade
```

```
$ shorebird account subscribe

Once Stripe has processed your payment, you will be able to use Shorebird to create and publish apps.

Note: This payment link is specifically for your account. Do not share it with others.
