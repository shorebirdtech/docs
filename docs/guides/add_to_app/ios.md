# Code Push With Add-to-App

This guide explains how to use Shorebird in an iOS add-to-app scenario.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have already have an iOS app and a Flutter module. Our
iOS app will be named `IosCodePushDemo` and our Flutter module will be named
`flutter_module`.

This guide also assumes that you have created a Shorebird account. If you have
not created a Shorebird account, please see our [code push guide](../../code-push)
for instructions.

The reference code for this guide is available at
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/samples/tree/main/add_to_app.

## Add Shorebird to your Flutter module

First, run `shorebird init` in your Flutter module:

```sh
shorebird init
```

## Embed the Flutter module in your iOS app

Shorebird requires that your Flutter module be embedded in your iOS app as an
.xcframework.

:::info
The steps to do this are the same as the
[option B in the official instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/ios/project-setup#option-b---embed-frameworks-in-xcode),
so in the event of a conflict between the docs here and the official docs, defer
to the official docs.
:::

### Add the path to your .xcframeworks to Framework Search Paths

In your app target's build settings in Xcode, add the path to your Flutter
module's Release `.xcframeworks` directory to Framework Search Paths. The value
you use for this path will be the path to the `Release` directory and will be
relative to your app's `.xcodeproj` file.

### Embed App.xcframework and Flutter.xcframework in your app

In the Build Phases tab of your app target, add the App.xcframework and
Flutter.xcframework from your Flutter module to the "Embed Frameworks" build
phase:

### Ensure the frameworks are signed as part of the build process

In the General tab of your app target, ensure that the frameworks have the
"Embed and Sign" option selected:

![Xcode embed and sign](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/assets/581764/5c3dbc9b-0301-4703-968c-cc84304f206b)

## Create a Shorebird release

Create a Shorebird release for your Flutter module:

```
shorebird release ios-framework-alpha --release-version 1.2.3+1
```

The `release-version` parameter needs to match the version of the iOS app
that uses this module (i.e., `version+build` from the Xcode settings, or
`CFBundleShortVersionString+CFBundleVersion` from your app's Info.plist).

![Xcode build version](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/assets/581764/b716fe38-1cd0-46b2-bf80-c29241e433a1)

_The version number for this app would be 1.0.0+3_

:::note
Because Shorebird only works with release builds, this will only produce a
release version of your archive. This is similar to running
`flutter build ios-framework --no-debug --no-profile`.
:::

## Verify that your app runs

In Xcode, update the current scheme's build configuration to "Release" and run
your app. Your app should work as before with no differences.

## Submit your app to the App Store

We won't cover this step in detail here, but this is where you would submit your
app to the App Store. For code push to work, it is important that you submit
_with the same `xcframework` generated by the release command above_.

## Verify that Shorebird is working with a patch

Make an edit to the code in your Flutter module. Then run:

```
shorebird patch ios-framework-alpha --release-version 1.2.3+1
```

:::note
`patch` will overwrite the `xcframework` generated by `release`, meaning that
you will see a "hash mismatch" error if you run the app from Xcode.
:::

As with the `release` command, the release version should be the version of the
iOs app that uses this module.

Now run the app directly from the a device (_not_ launched from Xcode), navigate
to the Flutter screen, and verify that the patch is recognized and applied.
