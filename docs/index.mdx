# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through [installing Shorebird](#install-📦), [creating an account](#sign-up-✍️), and logging in.

:::info
Currently all interactions with Shorebird are done via the `shorebird` command
line tool. Shorebird does not yet have a web interface.
:::

## Install 📦

To install the Shorebird command line interface (CLI):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maclinux" label="Mac/Linux" default>

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Needed to execute remote scripts
iwr -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.ps1'|iex
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Installing Shorebird CLI requires `git`.
:::

This installs `shorebird` into `~/.shorebird/bin` and adds it to your `PATH`. It
also installs a copy of Flutter and Dart inside
`~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`. The copy of Flutter is slightly modified to
add Shorebird code push and is not intended to be added to your `PATH`. You can
continue to use the versions of Flutter and Dart you already have installed.

:::info
The total installation is about 300mb.
:::

Once the installation has completed, `shorebird` should be available in your
terminal:

```
$ shorebird
