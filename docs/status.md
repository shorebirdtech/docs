## Stable

Shorebird is available on Android and iOS (alpha), with many apps shipping
to the Play Store and App Store.

We're working closely with our customers to ensure we're building things they
want. We _want_ your feedback. We _want_ you to tell us what you want to see
next.

Filing [issues](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues) is a good way
to provide feedback. Feedback via [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) is
also welcome.

Our guiding principle for these early days is "first, do no harm". It should be
the case that using Shorebird is never worse than not using Shorebird. It is
still possible using early versions of Shorebird could break your app in the
wild. However thousands of apps have already tried Shorebird this year and we
have only ever seen one break in the wild (a bad interaction with a third party
library). Please let us know if you encounter any issues.

## iOS Alpha

Shorebird is currently in alpha on iOS. Instructions for using Shorebird on
iOS are available in the [Getting Started](/) guide.

It is safe to ship with Shorebird on iOS. Please note there may be performance
(currently slower than Android) and patch size (larger than Android) differences
in the alpha product.

We expect to reach parity with Shorebird on Android around September 2023.

You can see all open issues for iOS [on

## Known issues

Commonly requested features on iOS and Android:

- Asset changes (images, icons, etc.) [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318)
- Older Flutter versions or `beta` and `master` channels (only latest `stable` is supported): [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/472)
- Manual rollbacks (automatic single-device rollbacks on errors already work) ([issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/126))
- Staged rollout of patches (channels or percentage based) [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/110)
- Patch signing (patch hashes are already checked) [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/112)
- Analytics [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/197)
- Fastlane integration [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/257)
- Self-hosting or on-premises deployments [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/485)
- "Native code" changes (java, kotlin, etc.) -- not planned.

iOS "alpha" specific issues (which will be resolved before production):

- iOS apps built with `shorebird release ios-alpha` may run Dart code slower
  than regular Flutter release builds.
  issues [1](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/673)
  [2]https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/674]
- iOS patches are proportional to the size of the app, rather than the size of
  the change, and thus larger than patches on Android.
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/675)
- `shorebird patch ios-alpha` does not warn for non-Dart changes
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/679)
