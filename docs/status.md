## Stable

Shorebird is available on Android and iOS, with ~1000 apps using Shorebird on
the App Store and Play Store.

## Link Percentage (iOS)

As part of [complying with the the App Store
guidelines](faq#does-shorebird-comply-with-app-store-guidelines), Shorebird uses
a interpreter on iOS to run any changed Dart code in your patch. This
interpreter runs Dart about 100x slower than running on the CPU. To make patches
run fast, Shorebird has modified Dart to make it possible to _only_ run changed
code on the interpreter and run any unchanged code on the CPU. This
determination is done at a per-function level.

The program that decides which code runs on the CPU vs the interpreter is called
the "linker" and we call this percentage the "link percentage".

Most of the time this system works very well, and Shorebird is able to run 90%+
of your Dart code on the CPU. However there are still a few types of changes
which can confuse the "linker" into running more code on the interpreter than
necessary.

Any percentage below 50% might cause your app to run slower than normal, which
is why you saw a warning and followed to this link.

Known linker issues include:

- [Adding or removing a class can affect link percentage](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1825)

If your app has reported an unexpectedly low link percentage, please let us
know, we'd love to help. You can report an issue here:
