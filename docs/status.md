## Stable

Shorebird is available on Android and iOS (alpha), with many apps shipping
to the Play Store and App Store.

Our guiding principle has been "first, do no harm". It should be
the case that using Shorebird is never worse than not using Shorebird.

We're working closely with our early customers and we would love to hear from
you. Shorebird operates publicly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird)
every day and we welcome your feedback. Filing
[issues](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues) works well too.

## iOS Beta

Shorebird is currently Beta on iOS. Instructions for using Shorebird on
iOS are available in the [Getting Started](/) guide.

iOS is currently marked beta because some applications experiance a noticable
slowdown after patching. We expect to have a solution to this problem in the next few months.
