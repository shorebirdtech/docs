# Releasing an code push app

This guide walks you through releasing a code push app to the Play Store and applying a patch to that release.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have an existing Shorebird app. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the [code push quickstart](../code-push-quickstart/) guide.

## Creating a release

To create a release, run:

```sh
shorebird release
```
