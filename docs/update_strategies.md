# ⬆️ Update Strategies

By default, Shorebird checks for, and silently
installs any, updates in the background on launch. It does this via a
background thread, to ensure that it does not affect the launch speed
of your application. Updates installed via Shorebird are then used on next
launch of the app.

For most users we recommend this default behavior as we believe it's generally
best for users to not have to think about whether or not they're running the
latest version of your app, things are just magically up to date.

However, Shorebird also provides you with the ability to control when updates
are applied. Sometimes you may wish to prevent the user from using the app
until they've updated to the latest version. For example, if you've made a
breaking change between your app and your server, or if you app communicates
between peers and you've made a breaking change to the protocol.

For such cases, we've developed `package:shorebird_code_push` which provides
you programmatic control over the Shorebird updater. You can use this package
to check for updates at a time of your choosing, and to prompt the user to
update if you wish.

You may also wish to _disable_ this default update-on-launch behavior, and
instead check for updates only at a time of your choosing.

To disable auto-update behavior add:

```yaml
auto_update: false
```

To your shorebird.yaml file.

You could imagine wanting to do this if you have a large number of users, and
your own controlled rollout of updates (to only update some accounts at a time
to reduce your server load, or reduce rollout risk), you could disable the
default behavior and instead check for updates only when you want to.

# Triggering updates via notification

As mentioned above, Shorebird provides a `package:shorebird_code_push` which
allows you to additional control over when updates are applied.

One use case for this would be to use a notification system to trigger updates.

Shorebird does not provide its own notification service, but it's possible to
use others, such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send a notification to
your app, and then use that notification to trigger an update. Since these
services typically allow you to target specific devices, you could use this to
trigger updates for specific users.

Any notification service which uses Dart (e.g. FCM) will also trigger the launch
of the Flutter engine when the notification comes in. When the Flutter engine
is launched, the default auto_update behavior will run. Thus when a
notification is received if the app is not already running it will update as
part of launching. More reliable however is to use the
`package:shorebird_code_push` to trigger the update from within a notification handler.

# Patches vs. Releases

Shorebird can only execute code (and thus run its patch logic) when the app is
running. So when a user installs your app from the first time and the app (and
thus Shorebird's code) has not yet run, they will see whatever version of your
app was last pushed to the store. If you've published a patch, they will not
see any patches until they have opened the app at least twice. The first launch
can check for (and apply) new patches, but a second launch is required to boot
from the patched code.

As discussed above, if it is important to your business to gate usage of your
app on users having the latest code, it could be appropriate for you to
check for updates as part of a login screen, or other launch gate. We do not
yet offer an example of this, but
[intend to add one](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/950).
Checking
for updates does require a network connection. It would also be possible
for you to only gate users if they've not received a "no new version" message
in within a certain amount of time.

We intend to add support for Shorebird to support releasing to the app stores
on your behalf in the future. But right now when you `shorebird patch` it
does not publish your a new "release" to the app store, so the patch will
only be visible to users after they've opened the app at least twice as discused
above.

Shorebird also does not yet automatically support deploying a patch across
multiple versions of your app, although such is possible with some automation.
For example, one could write a shell script which took a given git commit and
checked out your various release branches, cherry-picked that commit onto those
branches, and ran `shorebird patch` for each of those branches. We would like
to[support something like this](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/860) out of the box for
you in the future, but do not yet.

# How should Shorebird interact with other update systems (e.g. `in_app_update`)?

For applications which are already enforcing users are always on the latest
version e.g. with `in_app_update`, you will likely want to write some code to
coordinate between Shorebird and your existing update system.

`package:shorebird_code_push` can help you here. For example, with `in_app_update`
which is a system on Android whereby the Play Store will automatically prompt
users to update your app, you could use `package:shorebird_code_push` to check
if the user has already applied the necessary patch and _not_ then prompt
them to update.

Shorebird patches are typically much smaller than full playstore updates (e.g.
a few hundred bytes, or a few kilobytes), so it is likely better for your users
(saves them data) if you can use Shorebird to deliver patches instead of
`in_app_update`. However there are changes which Shorebird cannot make, such as
changes to "native" code (Java, Kotlin, Swift, ObjC) or changes to the Flutter
engine itself. So you may still want to encourage users to update via
`in_app_update` in some cases. Again, you will want to write some code to
coordinate between Shorebird and your existing update system to make this
determination.

Shorebird "patches" also do not change the version number of your app, so
`in_app_update` will not see them as a new version. This is by design, patches
are applied "to" releases, rather than being new releases themselves. This
can complicate your analytics/reporting code as you will have the case where
e.g. `1.0.1+13, patch 1` has identical dart code to `1.0.1+13, no patches`.
You can get the current booted patch number via `package:shorebird_code_push`
https://pub.dev/documentation/shorebird_code_push/latest/shorebird_code_push_io/ShorebirdCodePush/currentPatchNumber.html

We would like to move to a world where Shorebird is push-to-deploy and you don't
have to think about the difference between a patch and a release, but we're
likely still several months away from such a world.

Shorebird also currently makes the guarantee that we do not see or store
your code. To do "push to deploy" we may need to modify that guarantee which
is not a light decision.

# Do you need to to make a release to change your version of Flutter?

Yes. Shorebird is only capable of patching Dart code, not native code. So
new versions of the Flutter engine (which are written in C++) cannot be
patched via `shorebird patch`.
