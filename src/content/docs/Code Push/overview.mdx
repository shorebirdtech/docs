## What is Code Push?

Code Push is a tool that allows you to update your Flutter app instantly over
the air, without going through the store update process. This allows you to
directly deploy fixes and new features to your end users' devices.

## How does Code Push work?

Apps built with Shorebird include a modified Flutter engine, which checks for
updates to your app's Dart code on startup. If an update is available, the
engine downloads the update. The user will see the update on the next app
restart after the update is downloaded.

A typical Code Push workflow looks like this:

1. Use the Shorebird CLI to create a new **release** of your app.
1. Distribute that release through the App Store or Google Play.
1. Make changes to your app's Dart code. This could be a bug fix, a new feature,
   or anything else, and is not limited to your app's UI – this can include
   updated Dart dependencies as well.
1. Use the Shorebird CLI to create a new **patch** to the release you created in
   the first step.
1. That's it! Your users will see the update the next time they restart your
   app.

A more detailed walkthrough of this process is available in the
[Getting Started](/) guide.

## Concepts

This section contains a high-level overview of various concepts within
Shorebird. Feel free to skip it now and come back later if you need.

### Code Push

Code push, also referred to as "over the air updates" (OTA) is a cloud service
enabling Flutter developers to deploy updates to their apps in production.
Shorebird currently works on Android and iOS and will eventually work everywhere
Flutter works.

"Code Push" is a reference to the name of a deploy feature used by the React
Native community from [Microsoft](https://appcenter.ms) and
[Expo](https://expo.dev), neither of which support Flutter.

### Patching

Patching is the process of updating an application's code without requiring the
user to download a new version from the App Store or Play Store. This is done by
creating a patch, which is a set of changes to the application's code that can
be applied over-the-air.

#### What types of changes can be included in a patch?

Patches can change any Dart code in your application. This includes:

- App code
- Generated code (including `app_localizations` if following the recommended
  [Internationalization Approach](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization))
- Dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`, as long as they don't include native code
  changes.

This does **not** include:

- Asset files (images, fonts, etc.), although we have plans to support this in
  the near future (see https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318).
- Native code (e.g. Java/Kotlin on Android or Objective-C/Swift on iOS).
- Flutter engine changes (i.e., you cannot change the Flutter version of your
  app using Code Push).

### Glossary

#### Application

An application is what is created by running `flutter create [app_name]` and
corresponds to a listing in the App Store or Play Store.

Each application has a unique `app_id` that is assigned when you run
`shorebird init`. You can find your application's id in the `shorebird.yaml`
file at the root of your project.

An application can have zero or more [releases](#release).

:::note

Applications that use build flavors will have a unique `app_id` for each flavor.

:::

#### Release

A release is a specific version of an [application](#application), identified by
a version and build number (e.g. `1.0.0+1`). Although code push works for apps
distributed outside of the App Store and Play Store, a release most often
corresponds with a specific version of your app that is published to the App
Store or Play Store.

A release can have zero or more [patches](#patch) applied to it.

Releases are created by running `shorebird release [platform]`, where `platform`
is `android`, `aar`, `ios`, or `macos`.

#### Patch

A patch is a change to a specific [release](#release), applied as an
over-the-air update. For example, a patch could be a bug fix or a new feature.
Multiple patches can be published for a given release, although only one patch
can be active at a time. Patches are identified by their associated release
version and a patch number, which is an auto-incrementing integer.

When your application starts, it checks for available patches and applies the
latest one. This patch will be visible the next time your application launches.

Patches are created by running `shorebird patch [platform]`, where `platform` is
`android`, `aar`, `ios`, or `macos`.

#### Artifact

An artifact is the output of a build or patch operation. For example:

- `shorebird release android` generates and uploads several
  architecture-specific `libapp.so` files and an Android archive (.aab) file.
  These are **release artifacts**.
- `shorebird patch android` generates and uploads diff files that capture
  differences between your Dart code at patch time and the code in the
  associated release. These are **patch artifacts**.
