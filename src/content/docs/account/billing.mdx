We believe billing should never be a blocker to using our tools. We aim to meet
our customers where they are. Whether that means flexible payment methods,
enterprise invoicing, or custom terms. If you’re building with Flutter, we want
to make it as easy as possible to build with Shorebird too.

## Payment Provider - Stripe

Shorebird uses Stripe for all billing and payments. We accept any payment method
that Stripe supports. You can view more details in
[Stripe's Supported Payment Methods documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview).

### Billing Email

Invoices are sent at the end of each billing period by Stripe. Since they are
sent by Stripe, they do not use your Shorebird account email, but rather the
email associated with your Stripe account. In most cases these emails are the
same, but you can change them to be different.

If you'd like invoices sent to a different email address than the one use you
log in,, you can change this in Stripe:

1. Navigate to your "Account" panel within Shorebird.
2. Click on the drop-down menu on the right side.
3. Select "View Billing Portal"

This will open Stripe's billing portal, where you can update your Stripe email,
which is where invoices are sent.

## Available Plans

We provide flexible options to accommodate every team and product, weather it's
an indie/hobby project or a globally launched enterprise application. See our
[pricing page](https://shorebird.dev/pricing) for more information.

Most customers can easily get started with our self service Pro and Business
plans. If you need invoice billing, alternative payment methods, or support for
more then 2.5 million patches per month please
[reach out to us regarding an Enterprise Plans](https://shorebrid.dev/talk-to-sales).

## How We Bill

Shorebird charges based on successful patch installs. A “patch install” is a
successful update applied on a customer’s device.

- Patch installs are only billed upon successful download and application of a
  patch.
- Users always skip to the latest patch. If you send two patches before a user
  updates, you’re only billed for one patch install for that user.
- You are not charged if the user never launches the patched application.

You can view your current patch installs in
[your accounts page](https://console.shorebird.dev/account) on the Shorebird
Console. These numbers are updated hourly.

## Overage Billing

For our monthly plans, we offer optional overage billing. This is turned off by
default.

Customers can control their spending limits in the
[Shorebird Console](https://console.shorebird.dev). Your spending limit defaults
to the price of your plan. We'll notify you via email once when you’re close to
your limit, and again when you’ve reached your limit.

Clicking the "Change Limit" button let's you set a new spending limit and see
the corresponding number of patches available for your billing cycle.

Overage charges appear on the next month's invoice.

### Example

If you purchase a Pro plan (which includes 50,000 patch installs) and use
100,000 patches every month:

- You'll be billed $20 at the time of purchase (Month 1)
- At the start of each subsequent month, you'll will be billed for the 50,000
  patch installs for the that month, plus the 50,000 overages from the previous
  month, for a total of $40.
