## Canceling your subscription

To cancel your subscription, navigate to the
[Account](https://console.shorebird.dev/account) page on the Shorebird console,
select the "Edit" dropdown, and click "Cancel Subscription".

This will take you to a Stripe page that will allow you to cancel your
subscription. After cancelling, your access (and updates for your users) will
continue until the end of the current billing period. After this, Shorebird will
no longer send updates to your apps. Your apps will continue to function
normally.

## Deleting your account

To delete your account, email us at contact@shorebird.dev. We'll be happy to
help.
