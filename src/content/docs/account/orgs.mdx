Organizations are a way share groups of apps with people. This is
useful for any team collaborating across a company to have access as needed to releases, patches, and more.

## Account Requirements

Shorebird's paid plans unlocks features for collaborating with your peers.
Shorebird free plan users can upgrade to a paid plan to access these features
via the account settings page in the
[Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev/account).

If you do not see the plan you're expecting, please reach out to
contact@shorebird.dev we'd be happy help you.

## Creating an Organization

To create an organization, visit the Shorebird console and click the account
dropdown in the top left corner. From there, click the "+" button next to
"Organizations".

This will automatically create a new organization called "My Organization". You
can head over to the organization's settings to change the details of it
including the name.

## Managing Apps

Organizations can have multiple apps associated with them. You can either
transfer existing apps to an organization or create new apps within the
organization directly.

### Create a New App

To create a new app within an organization, select the organization when running
`shorebird init`:

## Member Roles

Organization roles apply to all apps within the organization and can be managed
via the organization settings page in the Shorebird console. The roles available
to you are based on the plan that you have.
