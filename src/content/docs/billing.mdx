description: How Shorebird handles Billing
---

Shorebird uses Stripe for all billing. We accept payment in any method
that Stripe accepts.

Annual billing, invoice billing and other payment methods are also available to
customers purchasing over 1M patches per month, or custom enterprise plans. See
our [pricing page](https://shorebird.dev/pricing) for more information.

The Shorebird Pro plan costs $20 per month, which is billed monthly, at the
beginning of each billing cycle, starting with time of purchase.

Shorebird charges based on successful patch installs. Which are reported from
your app to Shorebird servers on successful launch of your application with
a newly installed patch.

The Shorebird Pro plan includes 50,000 patch installs and supports optional
overage billing for installs beyond 50,000.

See [our blog](https://shorebird.dev/blog/simplified-pricing/) for instructions
on how to enable overage billing.

Overages will appear on the next month's invoice. So for example, say that you
purchase a Pro plan, but use 100,000 patches every month.

- You will be billed $20 at time of purchase (Month 1)
- Month 2 and forward you will be billed for the 50,000 for the current month,
  as well as the 50,000 overages from the previous month, for a total of $40.

You can view records of patch installs in [your accounts
page](https://console.shorebird.dev/account) on the Shorebird Console. These
numbers are updated hourly.
