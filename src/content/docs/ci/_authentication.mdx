Most Shorebird functionality, like creating releases and patches, requires being
authenticated. In order to authenticate with Shorebird in CI, you will need to
generate a CI token.

```sh
shorebird login:ci
```

You will be prompted to go through a similar OAuth Flow as when using `shorebird
login`, however, `shorebird login:ci` will not store any credentials on your
device. Instead, it will output a base-64 encoded auth token that you will use
in your CI environment.

The output of this command should look something like:

```
$ shorebird login:ci
The Shorebird CLI needs your authorization to manage apps, releases, and patches on your behalf.

ðŸŽ‰ Success! Use the following token to login on a CI server:

Example:

export SHOREBIRD_TOKEN="$SHOREBIRD_TOKEN" && shorebird patch android
```

:::caution
The `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` is a secret and should not be checked in to your source
control or shared publicly.
