description: The details of the Analyze check in Shorebird CI
---

Shorebird CI's "Analyze" check uses
[`dart analyze`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-analyze) to perform static analysis
across all of your Dart files.

## Requirements

None. As long as your repository has Dart code detected this check will run.

If you have an `analysis_options.yaml` file with customizations, they are
recognized during this check.

## Available Statuses

### Pass

This check passes if the check returns `No issues found!`.

### Fail

This check fails if the check finds any analysis issues.
