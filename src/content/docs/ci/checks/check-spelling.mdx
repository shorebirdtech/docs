Shorebird CI's "Check Spelling" check uses [CSpell](https://cspell.org/docs/) to
look for misspelled words in your code base.

## Requirements

This check only runs if a CSpell Config file is found in the repository. For
more information on this please consult the
[Getting Started in CSpell Docs](https://cspell.org/docs/getting-started#1-create-a-configuration-file)
for details.

## Available Statuses

### Pass

This check passes if the check returns `Issues found: 0 in 0 files`.

### Fail

This check fails if the check finds any mispellings in any files.
