description: The details of the Format check in Shorebird CI
---

Shorebird CI's "Format" check uses
[`dart format`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) to look for consistent
formatting across all of your Dart files.

## Requirements

None. As long as your repository has Dart code detected this check will run.

If you have an `analysis_options.yaml` file with customizations, they are
recognized during this check.

## Available Statuses

### Pass

This check passes if the check returns `0 changed`.

### Fail

This check fails if the check finds changes in files.
