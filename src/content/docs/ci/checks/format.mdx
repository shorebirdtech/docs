Run Dart Format Checks

## Description

Shorebird CI's "Format" check uses
`[dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format)` to look for consistent
formatting across all of your Dart files. If you have a analysis_options.yaml
file with customizations they are recognized during this check.

## Available Statuses

### Pass

This check passes if the format check returns "0 changed".

### Fail

This check fails if the format check finds changes in files.
