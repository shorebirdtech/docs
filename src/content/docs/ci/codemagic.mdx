# Codemagic Workflow Integration

This guide will help you integrate Shorebird into your Codemagic Workflow using
the [Codemagic
YAML](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

The reference code is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/codemagic_demo.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that:

1. Shorebird CLI is installed on your machine ([guide](https://docs.shorebird.dev/#install)).
1. Codemagic is connected to your repository ([guide](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-flutter-app/#adding-the-app-to-codemagic)).

## Authentication

<Authentication />

Next, copy the generated `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` and navigate to your Codemagic
secrets:

1. Select the "teams" tab on the left sidebar.
1. Select the team you want to add the secret to.
1. Select the "Global Variables and Secrets" tab.
1. Enter `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` as variable name.
1. Paste the token into the variable value field.
1. Add it to a group named `shorebird`.
1. Ensure "Secure" is checked.

## Set up an Android workflow

This section shows you how to set up a Codemagic workflow to create Android
releases, distribute them to the Play Store, and patch them once they've been
distributed.

:::note

We will be setting up our workflow using the Codemagic YAML file. The Workflow
Editor is not supported, as it does not allow us to change the build command.

If you don't know how to use the Codemagic YAML, please refer to the [Codemagic
YAML documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

:::

As a preview, our finished `codemagic.yaml` file will look like this:

```yaml
definitions:
  environment:
    shared_env: &shared_env
      flutter: 3.24.1
      groups:
        - shorebird
        - play_store
      vars:
        FLUTTER_VERSION: 3.24.1
  scripts:
    - &shorebird_install
      name: Install Shorebird
      script: |
        # Install Shorebird
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

        # Add Shorebird to PATH
        echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
    - &fetch_dependencies
      name: Fetch Dependencies
      script: |
        flutter pub get

workflows:
  release-android-workflow:
    name: Release Android
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      <<: *shared_env
      android_signing:
        - android_keystore
    scripts:
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      - name: Shorebird Release
        script: |
          shorebird release android \
            --flutter-version="$FLUTTER_VERSION"
    artifacts:
      - build/**/outputs/**/*.aab
      - build/**/outputs/**/mapping.txt
      - flutter_drive.log
    publishing:
      google_play:
        credentials: $GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS
        track: internal
  patch-android-workflow:
    name: Patch Android
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      <<: *shared_env
      android_signing:
        - android_keystore
    inputs:
      release_version:
        description: The release version to patch
    scripts:
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      - name: Shorebird Patch
        script: |
          shorebird patch android \
            --release-version=${{ inputs.release_version }}
```

### Prerequisites

#### Give Codemagic permission to publish to the Play Store

You can follow the Codemagic guide
[here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-code-signing/signing-android/#google-play-store-credentials)
to set this up. We put the `GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` variable in a
group named `play_store`.

#### Set up your Android keystore in Codemagic

You can follow the Codemagic guide
[here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-code-signing/signing-android/) to create a
keystore and upload it to Codemagic. We used `android_keystore` as the name of
the uploaded keystore.

You will also also need to update your `android/app/build.gradle` file to
use this keystore in the Codemagic CI environment:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
  release {
    if (System.getenv()['CI']) { // CI=true is exported by Codemagic
      storeFile file(System.getenv()['CM_KEYSTORE_PATH'])
      storePassword System.getenv()['CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD']
      keyAlias System.getenv()['CM_KEY_ALIAS']
      keyPassword System.getenv()['CM_KEY_PASSWORD']
    } else {
      keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
      keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
      storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
      storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Shared Configuration

At the top of our `codemagic.yaml` file, define shared environment variables and
scripts that will be used by multiple workflows. This has been annotated to
explain what each part does.

```yaml
definitions:
  environment:
    # Use &shared_env to allow us to reference this environment in other
    #   parts of the file
    shared_env: &shared_env
      flutter: 3.24.1
      groups:
        # Add the shorebird group to make $SHOREBIRD_TOKEN available to
        #   the Shorebird CLI.
        - shorebird
        # Add the play_store group to make $GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS
        #   available to the Google Play Publishing step.
        - play_store
      vars:
        FLUTTER_VERSION: 3.24.1
  scripts:
    # A step to install Shorebird and add it to the host machine's PATH
    - &shorebird_install
      name: Install Shorebird
      script: |
        # Install Shorebird
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

        # Add Shorebird to PATH
        echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
    - &fetch_dependencies
      name: Fetch Dependencies
      script: |
        flutter pub get
```

### Add the Android release workflow

Add the following workflow to your `codemagic.yaml` file. This has been
annotated to explain what each part does.

```yaml
workflows:
  release-android-workflow:
    name: Release Android
    # This can run on any instance type.
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      # Add the shared_env we defined in the definitions section.
      <<: *shared_env
      # Make the keystore available so we can use release signing.
      android_signing:
        # "android_keystore" is the name of the keystore we uploaded
        #   to Codemagic.
        - android_keystore
    scripts:
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      # Run `shorebird release android` to create a release.
      # This will upload the release to Shorebird and generate
      #   the artifacts listed below.
      - name: Shorebird Release
        script: |
          shorebird release android \
            --flutter-version="$FLUTTER_VERSION"
    # Tell Codemagic where to find the artifacts to publish.
    artifacts:
      - build/**/outputs/**/*.aab
      - build/**/outputs/**/mapping.txt
      - flutter_drive.log
    publishing:
      # Publish to the Google Play Store on the internal track.
      google_play:
        credentials: $GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS
        track: internal
```

With this, you should be able to create a release in Shorebird and publish it
to the Google Play Store via Codemagic.

### Add the Android patch workflow

Add the following workflow to your `codemagic.yaml` file. This has been
annotated to explain what each part does.

```yaml
workflows:
  patch-android-workflow:
    name: Patch Android
    # As with the release workflow, this can run on any instance type.
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      # Add the shared_env we defined in the definitions section.
      <<: *shared_env
      # Make the keystore available so we can use release signing.
      android_signing:
        # "android_keystore" is the name of the keystore we uploaded
        #   to Codemagic.
        - android_keystore
    # Add an input to allow us to specify the release version to patch.
    # This will make this workflow reusable across releases.
    inputs:
      release_version:
        description: The release version to patch
    scripts:
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      - name: Shorebird Patch
        # Run `shorebird patch android` to patch the specified release.
        script: |
          shorebird patch android \
            --release-version=${{ inputs.release_version }}
```

With this, you should be able to patch a release in Shorebird via Codemagic.

## Set up an iOS workflow

This section shows you how to set up a Codemagic workflow to create iOS
releases, distribute them to TestFlight, and patch them once they've been
distributed.

:::note

We will be setting up our workflow using the Codemagic YAML file. The Workflow
Editor is not supported, as it does not allow us to change the build command.

If you don't know how to use the Codemagic YAML, please refer to the [Codemagic
YAML documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

:::

### Prerequisites

#### Prepare your iOS code signing

Codemagic has a guide on how to set up code signing for iOS
[here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-flutter-app/). This
guide will help you generate the necessary keys, certificates, and provisioning
profiles and load them into Codemagic.

Once you've done that, you will need to make these available to your
`codemagic.yaml` scripts. You will end up with four environment variables to
support this:

- `KEY_ID`: This will be copied directly from App Store Connect.
- `ISSUER_ID`: This will be copied directly from App Store Connect.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will be the contents of the private key
  file you downloaded from App Store Connect. An easy way to get this into
  Codemagic is to run `cat /path/to/AuthKey_12345678.p8 | pbcopy` which will
  copy the contents of the file to your clipboard. You can then paste this into
  Codemagic.
- `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Follow [this
  guide](https://docs.codemagic.io/partials/code-signing-ios-obtain-certificate/)
  to obtain `ios_distribution_private_key` file. You can then paste the contents
  of this file into Codemagic. `cat ios_distribution_private_key | pbcopy` works
  well for this.

We put all of these variables into a group named `app_store`.

### Create a shared configuration

At the top of our `codemagic.yaml` file, define shared environment variables and
scripts that will be used by multiple workflows. This has been annotated to
explain what each part does.

:::note

Many of these scripts use the [Codemagic CLI
tools](https://docs.codemagic.io/knowledge-codemagic/codemagic-cli-tools/). You
don't need to install these, but they can be helpful if you want to debug
locally.

:::

```yaml
definitions:
  environment:
    shared_env: &shared_env
      flutter: 3.24.1
      groups:
        # Export the shorebird group to make $SHOREBIRD_TOKEN available to
        #   the Shorebird CLI.
        - shorebird
        # Export the app_store group to make the iOS code signing variables
        #   available the scripts below.
        - app_store
      vars:
        # The bundle ID of this example app.
        # Replace this with your app's bundle id.
        BUNDLE_ID: dev.shorebird.codemagic-demo
        FLUTTER_VERSION: 3.24.1
  scripts:
    # Download the Shorebird CLI and add it to the PATH.
    - &shorebird_install
      name: Install Shorebird
      script: |
        # Install Shorebird
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

        # Add Shorebird to PATH
        echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
    - &ios_initialize_keychain
      # Set up the keychain to be used for code signing. Create the keychain
      #   at specified path with specified password with given timeout.
      # Make it default and unlock it for upcoming use.
      name: Set up keychain to be used for codesigning using Codemagic CLI 'keychain' command
      script: |
        keychain initialize
    - &fetch_signing_files
      # Fetch provisioning profiles and code signing certificates for
      #   the Bundle ID with given identifier.
      name: Fetch signing files
      script: |
        app-store-connect fetch-signing-files "$BUNDLE_ID" \
          --type IOS_APP_STORE --create \
          --issuer-id "$ISSUER_ID" \
          --key-id "$KEY_ID" \
          --private-key="$APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY"
    - &add_certs_to_keychain
      name: Add certs to keychain
      script: |
        keychain add-certificates
    - &use_profiles
      # This generates an export_options.plist file that tells Xcode
      #   how to package our app. We explicitly set
      #   manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber so that we can control which
      #   version and build number are used for releasing and patching.
      name: Set up code signing settings on Xcode project
      script: |
        xcode-project use-profiles --custom-export-options={\"manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber\":false}
    - &fetch_dependencies
      name: Fetch Dependencies
      script: |
        flutter pub get
```

### Add the iOS release workflow

Add the following workflow to your `codemagic.yaml` file. This has been
annotated to explain what each part does.

```yaml
workflows:
  release-ios-workflow:
    name: Release iOS
    # This needs to run on a Mac instance.
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    integrations:
      # "Codemagic" is the name of our App Store Connect API key name.
      app_store_connect: Codemagic
    environment:
      <<: *shared_env
      # Tell Codemagic that we're signing our app for App Store distribution
      #   and to use the bundle ID we defined above.
      ios_signing:
        distribution_type: app_store
        bundle_identifier: "$BUNDLE_ID"
    scripts:
      # Use the scripts we defined in the definitions section.
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      - *fetch_signing_files
      - *ios_initialize_keychain
      - *add_certs_to_keychain
      - *use_profiles
      - name: Shorebird Release
        # Run `shorebird release ios` to create a release.
        script: |
          shorebird release ios \
            --flutter-version="$FLUTTER_VERSION" \
            --export-options-plist=/Users/builder/export_options.plist
    # Tell Codemagic where to find the artifacts generated by
    #   the `shorebird release ios` command.
    artifacts:
      - build/ios/ipa/*.ipa
    publishing:
      app_store_connect:
        # Use referenced App Store Connect API key to authenticate binary upload.
        auth: integration
        # Submit the release to TestFlight, where it can be downloaded by beta
        #   users and later patched by Shorebird.
        submit_to_testflight: true
```

With this, you should be able to create a release in Shorebird and publish it
to TestFlight via Codemagic.

### Add the iOS patch workflow

Add the following workflow to your `codemagic.yaml` file:

```yaml
workflows:
  patch-ios-workflow:
    name: Patch iOS
    # This needs to run on a Mac instance.
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      <<: *shared_env
      # Tell Codemagic that we're signing our app for App Store distribution
      #   and to use the bundle ID we defined above.
      ios_signing:
        distribution_type: app_store
        bundle_identifier: "$BUNDLE_ID"
    # Add an input to allow us to specify the release version to patch.
    # This will make this workflow reusable across releases.
    inputs:
      release_version:
        description: The release version to patch
    scripts:
      - *shorebird_install
      - *fetch_dependencies
      - *fetch_signing_files
      - *ios_initialize_keychain
      - *add_certs_to_keychain
      - *use_profiles
      - name: Shorebird Patch
        # Run `shorebird patch ios` to patch the specified release.
        script: |
          shorebird patch ios \
            --release-version=${{ inputs.release_version }} \
            --export-options-plist=/Users/builder/export_options.plist
```

With this, you should be able to patch a release in Shorebird via Codemagic.
