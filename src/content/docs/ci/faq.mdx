Still have a question about Shorebird CI that our docs didn’t cover? You’re in
the right place. This page covers the most common questions. If you have a
question not answered here or elsewhere in the docs, reach out on Discord or
file an issue. We’re here to help.

## Product Overview

### Why should I use this rather then another solution?

- **Designed for Flutter & Dart** - With this as our leading principal Shorebird
  CI has support for Flutter & Dart specific features. This includes automatic
  monorepo & workspace support, automatic parallelization across multiple
  package builds, and caching for all critical tooling for fast execution.
- **Zero config** - Nothing to think about (or worry about keeping up to date).
  Shorebird CI just “does the right thing” for Flutter and Dart projects. (We
  expect we’ll eventually expose a small amount of configuration, but we’re
  intentionally starting maximally simple.)
- **Fast** - On par with GitHub actions (and we know how to make it faster
  still). Quick boot ups, uses similar (if slightly larger) machine instances,
  uses namespace.so’s fancy caching mechanism, etc.

:::note

This is not currently designed to replace your existing release flow (e.g.
CodeMagic, fastlane, etc.) but rather to supplement them.

### How fast is it?

Our checks typically complete in under a minute even with large repos, including
monorepos. This is mostly due to our caching of Dart & Flutter and automatic
parallelization of packages. We will continue to invest in this over time as we
see more usage and understand the communities needs when it comes to Dart
specific pipelines.

### What checks are supported?

We are starting with a few key ones that we see our own need for and what other
open source repo's are doing. We will continue to keep our [Checks](/ci/checks/)
documentation up to date with what we currently have available.

If you have a specific check that you are looking for please don't hesitate to
reach out. We are always looking to implement more based on community needs.

## GitHub Integration

### What GitHub permissions does this require and why?

In order to use Shorebird CI, our GitHub Application requires the following
permissions

- **Read access to code, metadata, and pull requests** - This allows for our
  application to checkout your codebase and run the necessary checks. All code
  is securely deleted after runs.
- **Read and write access to checks, commit statuses, and workflows** - This
  allows for our application to report back on the status checks that are
  running and display them in the GitHub UI.

## Data Privacy

### Where do builds happen?

Builds are happening through our partnership with namespace.so. Namespace uses
several custom datacenters throughout the world and you can read more about this
in their [Documentation Site](https://namespace.so/docs) and
[Trust Center](https://trust.namespace.so).

### What data do you retain?

In order to provide a complete service we do need to retain some of your data.

- **Logs** - The only data we intentionally retain is your build logs, which are
  served from [CI Subdomain](https://ci.shorebird.dev). We also maintain some
  minimal metadata to associate a pull request/commit with a build log.
  - Our build provider [Namespace](https://namespace.so), also does retain logs
    in accordance with their [Terms of Use](https://namespace.so/terms).
- **Source Code** - We retain a copy of your public source code to speed up
  repeated builds. We do not currently have an explicit retention time on this.
  Private repositories are currently under development and will have more
  stringent requirements.

### How can I delete my data from the service?

You need to start by [uninstalling the app on GitHub](ci/uninstall). After this
no additional information or data will be sent to Shorebird CI.

Public log links are currently retained after an uninstall in order to not break
links on existing PRs. If you require those to be deleted as well please reach
out to us
[via email](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev?subject=CI%20Data%20Delete%20Request)
from the account owners address and it will be handled manually.
