{/* cspell:words Fastfile testflight */}

Fastlane is a popular tool for automating the build and release process for iOS
and Android apps. Shorebird can be integrated with fastlane to automate
releasing and patching.

## Installation

Follow the setup instructions on the fastlane website to install fastlane
([ios](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/),
[android](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/)).

## Setup

If you are not already using fastlane with your project, navigate to your app's
`ios` directory in your project and run `fastlane init`. You will be prompted to
answer several questions. For this guide, we will choose to manually add lanes
to the `Fastfile`.

## Use the Shorebird plugin

Run the following command to install the `shorebird` fastlane plugin, which
exposes the `shorebird_release` and `shorebird_patch` actions.

```bash
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin shorebird
```

## Update Fastfile to release

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :release_shorebird do
  shorebird_release(platform: "ios")
  upload_to_testflight
end
```

To run this, execute the following command:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane release_shorebird
```

:::note
To upload to TestFlight, you will need to create an Apple app-specific password.
You can do this at https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage. Once you have
created the password, create a `.env` file in your fastlane directory and add
`FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=your_password_here`.
:::

If you would like to provide additional arguments to the release command, you
can do so using the `args` parameter. For example:

```ruby
shorebird_release(platform: "ios", args: "--no-codesign -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```

## Update Fastfile to patch

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :patch_shorebird do
  shorebird_patch(platform: "ios")
end
```

This will patch the iOS release with the version number detected in the compiled
app and patch the release with that version.

As with `shorebird_release`, you can provide additional arguments to the patch
command using the `args` parameter.

```ruby
shorebird_patch(platform: "ios", args: "--allow-native-diffs -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```
