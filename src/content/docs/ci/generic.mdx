Building with Shorebird in CI should be a very small change from your existing
Flutter CI builds. Changes required:

1. Installing Shorebird on the builder.
2. Getting Shorebird credentials onto the builder.
3. Replacing `flutter build --release` with `shorebird release` or
   `shorebird patch`.

We have detailed instructions for integrating into

- [GitHub](/ci/github)
- [Codemagic](/ci/codemagic)

However if you do not use these providers, we've also provided generic
instructions below:

## Installing Shorebird

Installing Shorebird is identical to how you install it locally. Most builders
use Linux or Mac, which means running:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

for more details, see [Getting Started](/).

## Getting Shorebird credentials onto the builder

Shorebird cloud requires authentication to be able to publish releases to your
account. Doing so is two parts. One is getting the CI token from `shorebird`
installed on your local machine. The second is installing that token on the
builder.

import Authentication from './_authentication.mdx';

Now that you have a token, it is important to keep that token secure. We
recommend using a secrets manager for the token, or secure environment
variables, depending on your CI setup. `shorebird` commands will look for the
token to be in a `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Replacing `flutter build --release` with `shorebird`.

### Releasing

If you're already building with Flutter in CI, you should see a line similar to
`flutter build aab` or `flutter build ipa` in your CI config.

To move to Shorebird, you need only replace the `flutter build` line with
`shorebird release`. For example:

```
flutter build ipa --dart-define=HERO=Mario
```

Would become:

```
shorebird release ios --dart-define=HERO=Mario
```

`shorebird release` supports almost all of the same arguments that
`flutter build` does. If you ever see an error with `shorebird release` not
supporting an argument that `flutter build` does, you can use `--` to tell
`shorebird` to pass any argument after `--` down to `flutter build` separately,
e.g.

```
flutter build ipa --dart-define=HERO=Mario --enable-impeller
```

Would become:

```
shorebird release ios --dart-define=HERO=Mario -- --enable-impeller
```

`shorebird` can support building with different versions of Flutter. By default
`shorebird` will use whatever the most recent Flutter stable is, which can
change. If you'd like to pin your CI to a specific Flutter version you can do
this by adding `--flutter-version` to your command, e.g.

```
shorebird release ios --flutter-version=3.22.1 --dart-define=HERO=Mario -- --enable-impeller
```

### Patching

Patching is identical to releasing, just use `shorebird patch` instead of
`shorebird release`.

Patches with Shorebird can only ever apply to an existing Release. By definition
a patch is a set of changes to apply to a Release.

`shorebird patch` does not take a `--flutter-version` argument, instead takes a
`--release-version` argument, to specify which release version of your app
you're trying to patch. `shorebird` will look up the exact version of Flutter
used to build the release and use that exact version to build the patch.
