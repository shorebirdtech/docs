## What is Shorebird CI?

Zero config, production-grade continuous integration for Flutter & Dart.

Shorebird CI automatically runs best practice Flutter & Dart checks on every
pull request. We built it for ourselves and use it in all our repos and now you
can too!

- âœ¨ Setup takes < 1 min
- ðŸš€ Fast Checks
- âœ… Production Ready
- ðŸ’™ Built for Flutter & Dart

## Requirements for Use

Shorebird CI will work on any repository that contains at least one Flutter or
Dart project, including monorepos.

## How does Shorebird CI work?

When you install the
[Shorebird CI GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/shorebird-ci) on a GitHub
organization or repository, Shorebird CI is able to automatically run when a
relevant GitHub event occurs (e.g. a push or pull request). Shorebird CI
statically analyzes the repository to determine what checks need to be run and,
within seconds, the relevant jobs are queued and executed in parallel.

For most repositories, this will be a single package, and the job display name
will be the name of the package (derived from the `pubspec.yaml`). You can click
the job to view a summary, detailed logs, and overall results. Click
`"View more details on Shorebird CI"` to see the full logs in the
[Shorebird Console](https://console.shorebird.dev/ci).
