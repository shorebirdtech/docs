## What is Shorebird CI?

Zero config, production-grade continuous integration for Flutter & Dart.

Shorebird CI runs best-practice Flutter & Dart checks on every pull request
automatically. We built it for ourselves and use it in all our repos and now you
can too!

- âœ¨ Setup takes < 1 min
- ðŸš€ Fast Checks
- âœ… Production Ready
- ðŸ’™ Built for Flutter & Dart

## Requirements for Use

Shorebird CI will work on any Flutter/Dart project repository. This means as
long as you have a repository that meets one of the points below you can use
Shorebird CI.

- Contains a Flutter application
- Contains a Dart package

Shorebird CI will also work with mono-repo setups.

## How does Shorebird CI work?

When you install the Shorebird CI GitHub app on a repository, it subscribes to
pull request notifications. Each time a pull request is opened or updated,
Shorebird CI runs an initial check to analyze the repository and determine what
work needs to be performed. Within about 10 seconds, youâ€™ll see one or more jobs
appear directly on the PR.

For most repositories, this will be a single package, and the job will display
using the packageâ€™s name. You can click the job name to view detailed logs and
results. If youâ€™d like even more context, select "View more details on Shorebird
CI" to open the full run information in the Shorebird dashboard.
