Shorebird CI requires a "Pro" subscription in order to run checks on private
repositories. Upgrade to the "Pro" CI plan from the
[Web Console](https://console.shorebird.dev/ci).

Configuring Shorebird CI takes less than a minute and requires zero code
changes.

## Running Shorebird CI

When you open a pull request, or push a new commit to an existing pull request,
Shorebird CI will automatically run for you. It will detect if there are any
Dart or Flutter packages and automatically starts running the available checks.

To see more details from these checks you can
