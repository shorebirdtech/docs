Getting setup and running with Shorebird CI is quick and easy.

1. Go to the
   [Shorebird CI GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/shorebird-ci) in
   the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).
2. Click the "Install" button
3. Confirm the install and setup the correct permissions
   - We recommend choosing specific repositories, unless all your repos are
     Flutter/Dart. (Known Issue: Shorebird CI should automatically ignore
     non-Flutter/non-Dart repositories.)
4. Open a pull request or push a new commit to an existing pull request.

That's it!
