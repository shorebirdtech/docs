Fastlane is a popular tool for automating the build and release process for iOS
and Android apps. Shorebird can be integrated with fastlane to automate
releasing and patching.

## Installation

Follow the setup instructions on the fastlane website to install fastlane
([ios](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/),
[android](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/)).

## Setup

This guide assumes that you have shorebird installed on the machine that will be
running the fastlane commands. If you have not already installed shorebird, you
can do so by following the
[Getting Started instructions](/getting-started/quick-start).

If you are not already using fastlane with your project, navigate to your app's
`ios` directory in your project and run `fastlane init`. You will be prompted to
answer several questions. For this guide, we will choose to manually add lanes
to the `Fastfile`.

## Use the Shorebird plugin

Run the following command to install the `shorebird` fastlane plugin, which
exposes the `shorebird_release` and `shorebird_patch` actions.

```bash
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin shorebird
```

## Update Fastfile to release

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :release_shorebird do
  shorebird_release(platform: "ios")
  upload_to_testflight
end
```

To run this, execute the following command:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane release_shorebird
```

:::note

To upload to TestFlight, you will need to create an Apple app-specific password.
You can do this at https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage. Once you have
created the password, create a `.env` file in your fastlane directory and add
`FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=your_password_here`.

:::

If you would like to provide additional arguments to the release command, you
can do so using the `args` parameter. For example:

```ruby
shorebird_release(platform: "ios", args: "--no-codesign -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```

## Update Fastfile to patch

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :patch_shorebird do
  shorebird_patch(platform: "ios")
end
```

This will patch the iOS release with the version number detected in the compiled
app and patch the release with that version.

As with `shorebird_release`, you can provide additional arguments to the patch
command using the `args` parameter.

```ruby
shorebird_patch(platform: "ios", args: "--allow-native-diffs -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```
