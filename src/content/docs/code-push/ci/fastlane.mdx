Fastlane is a popular tool for automating the build and release process for iOS
and Android apps. Shorebird can be integrated with fastlane to automate
releasing and patching.

## Installation

Follow the setup instructions on the fastlane website to install fastlane
([ios](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/),
[android](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/)).

## Using fastlane on CI

This section assumes that you are using fastlane on CI to release your app. If
you are running fastlane locally (on your development machine), you can skip to
the [Using fastlane locally](#using-fastlane-locally).

A working example of this setup can be found in our
[fastlane_demo](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/fastlane_demo) repository.

To get started, follow [this
guide](https://medium.com/revelo-tech/setting-up-automatic-ios-release-with-fastlane-and-match-on-ci-cd-server-16c3f1d79bc5)
to set up fastlane with certificate management, code signing, and submitting to
the App Store/TestFlight.

You will notice that our demo app's
[`Fastfile`](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/fastlane_demo/blob/main/ios/fastlane/Fastfile)
has both `deploy` and `release_shorebird` lanes. The `deploy` lane comes from
the guide linked to above. The `release_shorebird` lane is our custom lane that
uses the `shorebird_release` action **in place of** `build_app` to build an ipa,
create a Shorebird release, and submit it to the App Store/TestFlight.

Note that this change from `build_app` to `release_shorebird` is the only
change needed to add Shorebird to your fastlane workflow.

### Patching

To patch your app, you can use the `shorebird_patch` action. You can see an
example of this in the `patch_shorebird` lane in the
[`Fastfile`](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/fastlane_demo/blob/main/ios/fastlane/Fastfile#L92-L98).


## Using fastlane locally

### Setup

Follow this section if you have shorebird installed on the machine that will be
running fastlane. This section assumes that you have shorebird installed on the
machine that will be running the fastlane commands. If you have not already
installed shorebird, you can do so by following the [Getting Started
instructions](/getting-started).

If you are not already using fastlane with your project, navigate to your app's
`ios` directory in your project and run `fastlane init`. You will be prompted to
answer several questions. For this guide, we will choose to manually add lanes
to the `Fastfile`.

### Use the Shorebird plugin

Run the following command to install the `shorebird` fastlane plugin, which
exposes the `shorebird_release` and `shorebird_patch` actions.

```bash
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin shorebird
```

### Update Fastfile to release

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :release_shorebird do
  shorebird_release(platform: "ios")
  upload_to_testflight
end
```

To run this, execute the following command:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane release_shorebird
```

:::note

To upload to TestFlight, you will need to create an Apple app-specific password.
You can do this at https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage. Once you have
created the password, create a `.env` file in your fastlane directory and add
`FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=your_password_here`.

:::

If you would like to provide additional arguments to the release command, you
can do so using the `args` parameter. For example:

```ruby
shorebird_release(platform: "ios", args: "--no-codesign -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```

### Update Fastfile to patch

Open the `Fastfile` in the `fastlane` directory and add the following lane:

```ruby
lane :patch_shorebird do
  shorebird_patch(platform: "ios")
end
```

This will patch the iOS release with the version number detected in the compiled
app and patch the release with that version.

As with `shorebird_release`, you can provide additional arguments to the patch
command using the `args` parameter.

```ruby
shorebird_patch(platform: "ios", args: "--allow-native-diffs -- --build-name=1.0.0")
```
