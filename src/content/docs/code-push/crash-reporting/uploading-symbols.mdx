Shorebird uses a fork of Flutter to build your app. This means we've built our
own copy of Flutter's engine which means that the symbols included in the
Flutter.framework or libflutter.so are slightly different from the upstream
Flutter engine.

If you would like to see C++ symbols from our fork of Flutter's engine in your
crash reports, you will need to upload the symbols to your crash reporting tool.

Google provides instructions for how to integrate various crash reporting tools
into your Flutter app:

https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/maintenance/error-reporting

# Getting Symbols from the Console

Shorebird's console provides links to download the symbols for both for your
built app and the Flutter engine in the "Artifacts" tab of the release page.

The current URL format for the console has this tab under:

```
https://console.shorebird.dev/apps/<app-id>/releases/<release-id>
```

# Manual instructions (only needed for CI or scripts)

If you need a way to download symbols as part of a CI pipeline it's possible
with the following information:

For a given Flutter version you will need the Flutter engine hash to download
the symbols. This hash is displayed in `shorebird doctor` output:

```
$ shorebird doctor
Shorebird 1.6.49 • git@github.com:shorebirdtech/shorebird.git
Flutter 3.32.5 • revision 44a8ada33bdbe7f25a49e7dcf13c5c1f648129fd
Engine • revision f275acddf709f94ef38af54adb2c1a0a0a90b5c6
```

In this case, we're using `f275acddf709f94ef38af54adb2c1a0a0a90b5c6` as the
engine hash.

## Symbols for iOS

Assuming engine hash `f275acddf709f94ef38af54adb2c1a0a0a90b5c6`, the iOS symbols
can be downloaded from the following URL:

## Symbols for Android

Assuming engine hash `f275acddf709f94ef38af54adb2c1a0a0a90b5c6`, the Android
