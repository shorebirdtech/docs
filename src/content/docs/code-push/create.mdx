:::note

If you have an existing project, you can use
[`shorebird init`](/code-push/initialize) to add Shorebird to your Flutter app.

:::

To create a new Flutter project with Shorebird, use `shorebird create`:

```sh
shorebird create my_app
```

This does several things:

1. Runs
   [`flutter create`](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/create-new-app#terminal)
   which generates a new Flutter project.
1. Runs [`shorebird init`](/code-push/initialize) which initializes Shorebird.

:::note

Refer to the official
[Flutter Create Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/create-new-app#terminal)
for more information on how to customize your new Flutter project.
