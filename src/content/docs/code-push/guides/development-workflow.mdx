This guide will walk through an opinionated development workflow with Shorebird.
We'll cover how to automate releasing and patching with Shorebird to streamline
the entire development process so that you and your team can focus on shipping
high quality features to customers.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are already familiar with Shorebird and have integrated
it into your application. Refer to the [getting started](/) instructions for
more information. In addition, this guide also assumes that you are familiar
with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com).

## Overview

Shorebird provides a set of tools that you can use to push over the air updates
to your customers but it's up to you to decide how to integrate it into your
development workflow.

While there are many ways to integrate Shorebird, the following workflow is a
common approach that we recommend:

![Development Workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61fc8e5b-b77e-42e7-a1d6-5db50a232d02)

The illustration above, uses
[trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) and tags to trigger
automated release and patch workflows.

The workflow consists of three main phases:

1. **Development**: Developers work on features and bug fixes.
1. **Release**: When a feature is ready, a release is created and distributed to
   customers (typically via stores).
1. **Patch**: If a critical bug is found, a patch is created and distributed to
   customers immediately via Shorebird.

Let's walk through each phase in more detail.

## Development Phase

During this phase, developers are building features and fixing bugs.

The development workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Create branch from trunk (main)
1. Work on task
1. Open a pull request to merge changes into trunk
1. Squash and merge after CI checks & code review. We recommend squashing
   commits to keep the commit history clean and to make it easier to cherry pick
   commits into release branches.

Note that with the described workflow, the trunk (e.g. main) is always in a
releasable state. This puts pressure on continuous integration (CI) checks to
ensure that the code on the trunk is always in a healthy, deployable state.
Checks that would typically run as part of the continuous integration process
include linting, formatting, unit tests, and integration tests. CI checks are
typically run on every pull request and must be passing before the pull request
can be merged.

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

## Release Phase

When the team is ready to distribute a new version of the app, a release is
created. In some cases, releases are created on a regular cadence (e.g. weekly,
bi-weekly, monthly) while in other cases, releases are created on an ad-hoc
basis.

The release workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Create a release branch (e.g release/v1.0.0) from trunk (main)
1. Create a new release on GitHub (e.g. v1.0.0). This tags the commit so that we
   can easily find the commit in the future and triggers the release workflow
1. The release workflow is triggered by the tag and generates signed artifacts
1. Distribute the artifacts (e.g. via AppStore, PlayStore, etc.)

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

<RemoteCode
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/flutter_and_friends/refs/heads/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml"
  title=".github/workflows/release.yaml"
/>

When the release workflow has finished running, the artifacts are ready to be
distributed to customers via the appropriate channels.

## Patch Phase

Even with great testing, sometimes bugs can creep into the app. Shorebird allows
you to fix these bugs and distribute the patches to customers devices
immediately rather having to wait for users to update.

The patch workflow can be broken down into the follow steps:

1. Fix the bug on the trunk branch using the development workflow described
   above.
1. Cherry pick the commit into the desired release branch(es)
   ```sh
   git checkout release/v1.0.0
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```
1. Create a new "hotfix" release on GitHub (e.g. v1.0.0-hotfix.1) This tags the
   commit so that we can easily find the commit in the future and triggers the
   patch workflow
1. The patch workflow is triggered by the tag and uploads the hotfix to the
   staging environment
1. Preview the release in the staging environment using the
   [Shorebird CLI](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird) and validate the
   fix
   ```sh
   shorebird preview --track=staging
   ```
   :::note
   Here and in the GitHub Actions workflow below, we use a track named `staging`
   to preview the hotfix in the staging environment. The name of the track is
   arbitrary and can be changed to any name you prefer.
   :::
1. Promote the hotfix to production from the
   [Shorebird Console](https://console.shorebird.dev).

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

<RemoteCode
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/flutter_and_friends/refs/heads/main/.github/workflows/patch.yaml"
  title=".github/workflows/patch.yaml"
/>

When the patch workflow has finished running, the hotfix is ready to be
validated in
[Shorebird's staging environment](/code-push/guides/staging-patches) and
promoted to production.

## Recap

In this guide, we took a look at an opinionated development workflow with
Shorebird which allows teams to automate releasing and patching in order to
iterate quickly while still delivering a high quality experience to customers.
