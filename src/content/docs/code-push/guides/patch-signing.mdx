In addition to our default security measures, Shorebird also provides patch
signing for additonal security. This is optional at this time and needs to be
setup during your build and patch process.

Patch signing allows developers to cryptographically sign patch updates with
their own keys. This ensures that no one (including Shorebird) can change the
content of your patches without your private cryptographic keys.

Signing works in two parts. First, `shorebird release` commands can take an
optional `--public-key-path` argument to embed a public key in your released
application. The [Shorebird updater](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater)
will enforce that only patches signed with a corresponding private key will be
allowed to load for applications that include a public key.

Second, when you build your patch with `shorebird patch`, you can pass
`--private-key-path` to have Shorebird sign your patch with your private key.
This is required if you created your release with a public key included.

There are no required changes to your code and you can add or remove this
signing requirement at any time by simply making a new release of your
application.

## Implementation

You will need an RSA key pair. Shorebird supports RSA keys in PEM format, both
PKCS#1 and PKCS#8.

### Generate Keys

If you do not already have an RSA key pair you'd like to use, you can generate a
pair with `openssl`:

```sh
# Generate a key pair
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

# Extract the public key
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

:::note

On Windows, you can use the `openssl` that comes with your git installation at
`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe`.

:::

The above operation will generate a public/private key pair in `private.pem` and
a public key in `public.pem`. The file containing the private key should be
stored securely and kept secret. While the private key is not itself sufficient
to make an update to your application (someone would also need access to your
Shorebird credentials), it should not be checked into public source control.

### Key Storage

Shorebird does not provided a Key Storage solution at this time. If you are
using this feature we highly recommend using a cloud key management service
instead of just storing keys on disk. **If for any reason you were to lose your
private key, there is no way to create a patch for an application containing the
corresponding public key.** Even Shorebird is not able to create a patch for
your application without your private key. In such a case, you would need to
make and distribute a new release of your application to send patches to it.

Shorebird does support command-based signing for integration with cloud key
management services (HashiCorp Vault, GCP Cloud KMS, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault),
hardware security modules (HSMs), and secrets managers (1Password, etc.).

See [Cloud KMS Examples](#cloud-kms-examples) below for integration examples
with popular services.

### Create a Signed Release

:::note

These examples use Android, but patch signing works on all platforms.

:::

To create a release that requires signed patches, run the following command:

```sh
# Build Release with local path to key file
shorebird release android --public-key-path /path/to/public.pem

# Build Release with command for cloud-managed public key
# Ensure that the command outputs a PEM-encoded public key to stdout
shorebird release android \
  --public-key-cmd="your-command-that-outputs-pem-public-key"
```

This will include the public key in the release artifact produced by
`shorebird release` and cause the released app to require signed patches.

### Create a Signed Patch

To create a signed patch, run the following command:

```sh
# Build Patch with local path to key files
shorebird patch android --public-key-path /path/to/public.pem \
 --private-key-path /path/to/private.pem

# Build Patch with cloud-managed signing
# Ensure that the command outputs a PEM-encoded public key to stdout
# sign-cmd Should read data from stdin and outputs a base64 signature to
#stdout
 shorebird patch android \
   --public-key-cmd="your-command-that-outputs-pem-public-key" \
   --sign-cmd="your-command-that-signs-stdin-and-outputs-base64"
```

This tells shorebird to sign the patch with the key pair you provided.

### Test and Verify Signed Patch

You can verify that the patch is properly signed using `shorebird preview`. On
the first launch, you should see something like the following in your app logs:

```
05-22 23:47:51.645  6963  6994 I flutter : updater::updater: Patch 1 successfully installed.
05-22 23:47:51.645  6963  6994 I flutter : updater::updater: Update thread finished with status: Update installed
```

If you close and relaunch your app, you should see this message telling you that
the patch's signature was verified:

```
05-23 11:32:33.944  7029  7029 I flutter : updater::cache::signing: Verifying patch signature...
05-23 11:32:33.944  7029  7029 I flutter : updater::cache::signing: Patch signature is valid
```

If the patch is missing a signature, or fails signature verification for any
reason, Shorebird will not load it, and will instead use any previously
installed and verifiable patch (if there is one) or the unpatched release
version of your app.

If you'd like to test the missing signature behavior, you can create a patch
without a private key and notice that `shorebird preview` rejects it. Similarly,
you can create a patch with a different private key to do the same.

## Fallback Behavior

Releases that contain a public key will reject all unsigned patches. If a patch
is missing a signature or its signature is invalid, Shorebird will reject this
patch at boot time. It will instead boot from the last known good patch (if
still on disk) or the release build of the app. This will not cause your app to
crash.

## Trade Offs

Signature verification does add a small overhead at app launch. During our
testing this has been obvserved to be under 50ms with a medium size app on a
5-year-old Android phone. This overhead increases with application size. For
very large apps, if this overhead shows up on your benchmarks, you can set
`patch_verification: install_only` in `shorebird.yaml` to verify signatures only
when patches are installed rather than on every launch.

## Cloud KMS Examples

The following examples show how to integrate Shorebird patch signing with
popular key management services using `--public-key-cmd` and `--sign-cmd`.

# Patch
shorebird patch android \
  --public-key-cmd="vault read -field=public_key transit/keys/shorebird-signing" \
  --sign-cmd="vault write -field=signature transit/sign/shorebird-signing \
