This article is about how Shorebird interacts with obfuscation and security
tooling.

## Obfuscation

> Obfuscate (noun): _the action of making something obscure, unclear, or
> unintelligible._

Obfuscation in software is a mechanism which takes a program and renames
internal pieces to hide them and make it harder to understand what the program
is doing. For example, if you had a function `placeOrder()`, an obfuscation
program might rename all instances of that function to `az5()` as part of
compilation to make it harder for someone to "de-compile" and understand what
your program was doing.

Obfuscation is also sometimes used for hiding internal company details such as
upcoming product names e.g. `connectToSecretNewProduct()` in your app. Although
"[secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning)"
may be a more reliable approach for those use-cases since obfuscation tools
might not find all the ways in which your company secrets could be encoded in
your binary.

## Flutter & Dart built-in Obfuscation

Flutter (via Dart) supports basic obfuscation out of the box.

All you have to do is pass `--obfuscate` to your `flutter build` (or
`dart compile`) command.

This obfuscation isn't particularly fancy, but it will rename all library,
method and field names in your program to unique identifiers during compilation.

Shorebird also supports this same obfuscation, on all platforms other than iOS.
Currently obfuscation support in Dart's compiler is incompatible with
Shorebird's other modifications on iOS. We have a plan to fix such, it just
hasn't reached the top of our list yet:

## Third Party Security Programs

There are a variety of third party security programs for mobile. The vast
majority of these work fine with Shorebird.

The major consideration when using a 3rd party security program is that it needs
to run _during_ the build of your application, not after.

Under the covers, `shorebird release` mostly calls `flutter build`. When that
build is complete, `shorebird release` takes a copy of the built artifact and
stores it securely in your Shorebird account. This is done both for your later
reference (e.g. so you can access it via `shorebird preview`) but also to make
`shorebird patch` possible. `shorebird patch` works by also calling
`flutter build` on your newly patched code, but then comparing that output to
the saved release artifacts.

As a result of this, if you run tools _after_ the build of your application and
thus send a _different_ version of your application to users, Shorebird will be
unable to crate a compatible patch for your users since they will be using a
different binary than you stored with Shorebird.

Other than the "it must be during the build" restriction, we've seen few issues
with third party security tools and Shorebird.

### GuardSquare on iOS

We have seen one issue with GuardSquare on iOS with Shorebird. Similar to the
lack of `--obfuscate` support for Shorebird with Dart, GuardSquare (at least in
some configurations) will make an attempt to "obfuscate" iOS binaries further
replacing the implementations of some functions with code which is used to
provide obscured access to constants/strings/numbers stored within the binary.
This is currently incompatible with our Dart modifications for iOS. If this is
an issue for your product, we'd be happy to discuss with your GuardSquare
support team if there are workarounds we could build together.
