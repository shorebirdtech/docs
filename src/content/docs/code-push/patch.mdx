import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Once you have published a release of your app, you can push updates using one
of the `shorebird patch` commands.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="patch-command-android" label="Android">

```
shorebird patch android
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="patch-command-ios" label="iOS">

```
shorebird patch ios
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="patch-command-macos" label="macOS (beta)">

```
shorebird patch macos
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will do several things:

1. Builds the artifacts for the update.
1. Downloads the corresponding release artifacts.
1. Generates a patch using the diff between the release and the current changes.
1. Uploads the patch artifacts to the Shorebird backend
1. Promotes the patch to the stable channel.

Example output:

✅ Published Patch!
```

By default, this uses the release version that the app is currently on. If you
want to patch a different release version, you can use the `--release-version`
option. For example:

```
shorebird patch android --release-version 0.1.0+1
```

If your application supports flavors or multiple release targets, you can specify the flavor and target using the `--flavor` and `--target` options:

```
shorebird patch [android|ios] --target lib/main_development.dart --flavor development
```

:::note
`shorebird patch` wraps `flutter build` and can take any argument
`flutter build` can. To pass arguments to the underlying `flutter build` you
need to put `flutter build` arguments after a `--` separator. For example:
`shorebird patch android -- --dart-define="foo=bar"` will define the `"foo"` environment
variable inside Dart as you might have done with `flutter build` directly.

### Patch Performance

#### Android

Patching an application on Android has no effect on performance.

#### iOS and macOS

Patching an application on iOS and macOS typically does not affect an application
performance. However the patching mechanism on iOS and macOS is different from Android.
Unchanged code runs as normal (on the CPU), changed (or added) code will run in
a Dart interpreter (slower than the CPU). Typically this change is
undetectable, but if you are changing particularly performance-sensitive Dart
code (e.g. code for processing images, or large data) you may see a performance
difference after patching.

You can always test your patches before sending them to users using by
[staging patches](/guides/staging-patches).

If you ever see unexpected performance changes when patching, please [contact
us](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev) we would love to help!
