Shorebird uses its own fork of Flutter.

Our fork works exactly as Google's does, including passing all the same
functionality and performance tests.

Using Shorebird's fork should not result in any change in your app. If you ever
see any change, please let us know so we can work with you to diagnose!

### Patching

Updating a Flutter app in production is unique to Shorebird's fork.

When using Shorebird your app has two different modes of running, un-patched
("release") and patched ("patch"). Both release and patch builds of your app
should function identically to as they would without Shorebird. The only caveat
is on iOS where patched builds can sometimes run slower than release builds due
to iOS restrictions.

The iOS App Store
[requires](https://docs.shorebird.dev/faq/#does-shorebird-comply-with-app-store-guidelines)
all app update systems (like Shorebird's) to use an interpreter. An interpreter
is a software program that can run other programs rather than running the
program directly on hardware. Interpreters are slow.

To work around the performance limitations of an interpreter, Shorebird's
updating system is designed to avoid using the interpreter as much as possible.
When you make a "patch" with Shorebird, Shorebird examines the change and
attempts to set up the "patch" to only run the _new_ or _changed_ code within
the interpreter (slow), and thus leave all un-changed code running on the CPU
(fast).

### Why iOS patches are sometimes slow

Most of the time when you make a change to a part of your program, only that
part of the program is changed. However sometimes small changes to one part of
the program can produce large changes in (seemingly) unrelated parts.

This is due to how compilers (programs that turn source code into machine code)
optimize their output. Dart's compiler uses several tricks to optimize programs
including "type flow analysis" and "inlining", both of which can cause these
unexpected non-local changes.

As an example, imagine you have a part of your program:

```
bool isEven<T extends int?>(T value) => value?.isEven ?? false;

void foo(int x) {
  print(isEven(x));
}
```

And you change it to add:

```diff
bool isEven<T extends int?>(T value) => value?.isEven ?? false;

void foo(int x) {
  print(isEven(x));
}

+ void bar(int? x) {
+   print(isEven(x));
+ }
```

In that example, `isEven` and `foo` didn't change. So you would expect Shorebird
should be able to run both of those on the CPU (not have to use an interpreter).
However this is unfortunately not the case. In the "before" case, because isEven
was never called with nullable values Dart optimized away all of the null checks
in the compiled `isEven` code. (That's a good thing.) Unfortunately that means
that when the new code now used `isEven` in a nullable context the compiled
contents of "isEven" change, to include null checks. Since the contents of
isEven changed, Shorebird will conservatively assume that the behavior of all
callers of `isEven` might have changed as well and we will not use the CPU
versions of those either. Thus if your change (however small) might happen to
have caused the Dart compiler to reconsider optimizations for some other
critical section of code, tiny changes can sometimes cause large sections of
your application to "un-link" and run in the interpreter.

### Avoiding Performance Changes in iOS patches

Unfortunately there is currently no good way to predict if a patch will cause a
performance change to your application.

The good news is that this behavior is relatively rare. 9 out of 10 patches do
not run into unexpected non-local changes like this and exhibit no difference
after patching. Furthermore, when performance impacting changes occur,
Shorebird's tooling and console will warn you. The bad news is that predicting
when a change will trigger the Dart compiler to cause non-local changes to your
program is very difficult.

When these non-local changes occur, the best recommendation we have at this time
is to try to make a new, smaller diff, and patch again.

For the vast majority of patches there is no performance difference at all. For
those which do see a difference, sometimes that difference may still be worth
the trade-off as a stop-gap between now and when a user can get an update via
the App Store.

We have several approaches to explore to remove this limitation on iOS and
intend to continue to improve this behavior in the future.
