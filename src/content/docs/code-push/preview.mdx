Once you have [created a release](/code-push/release), you can preview your
release on an Android device, Android emulator, or iOS device using the
`shorebird preview` command.

```sh
shorebird preview
```

This will download the release artifacts for the selected app release version,
install the app on the selected device, and start the application.

:::tip `shorebird preview` can be used on any computer that is configured for
Flutter development, not just the computer that was used to create the release.
This is useful for verifying releases that were created on a CI/CD server. :::

## Hybrid apps

Because Flutter modules (.aars and .xcframeworks, created with
`shorebird release aar` and `shorebird release ios-framework`, respectively) are
embedded in apps that Shorebird does not know about, `shorebird preview` does
not support them.

To test these releases, you can use your normal development flow with the
artifacts that Shorebird creates. For example, if you launch your app normally
from Xcode or Android Studio _with a Release configuration_, you will see
Shorebird logs in its output. If you have published a patch, it should be
downloaded on the first run of your app and visible on subsequent runs.
