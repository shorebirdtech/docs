_First, do no harm_

Shorebird is designed to be a drop-in replacement for stock Flutter, and can be
disabled at any time with no effect on your users.

## Thank you

Thank you for trying Shorebird. If you'd like to continue using Shorebird but
have questions or concerns, please reach out to us on Discord or via email at
[contact@shorebird.dev](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev).

Otherwise, we hope you'll consider trying Shorebird again in the future.

## Uninstalling Shorebird

Building with `shorebird build` will include Shorebird code push in your app.
Building with `flutter build --release` will not include Shorebird in your app.
At any time you can simply drop back to `flutter build` and things will work as
they did before.

You can remove `shorebird` from your path by removing it from your `.bashrc` or
`.zshrc` and deleting the `.shorebird` directory located in `~/.shorebird`.
