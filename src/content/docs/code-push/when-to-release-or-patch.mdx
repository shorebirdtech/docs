A common question that users have when using Shorebird is to decide when to make a release
versus when to make a patch.

If not already, be sure to check the definition of a [Release](/concepts#release) and a
[Patch](/concepts#patch) in the concepts page as that reading will probably give you a good sense
of what are releases and patches.

There isn't a single process that works for all cases, it depends a lot on how the app is
distributed, what the changes are usually about, etc. So in this document we will go through
some suggestion which the reader can use as example to apply to their own realities.

# When to do releases

### The app contains a new "big" feature

Even though technically it might be possible to send entirely new use cases of an app withing a
patch, doing so might create some problems.

If the app is distributed through the stores (Google Play and App Store), this would be against
their guidelines and rules. Large updates in an applications needs to go through their review
processes and using over the air updates might result in suspension of the application.

In apps not distributed via the stores, this can still bring bad experience to the users. If a big
new user flow is released through a patch and if a user downloads the app after the patch
was published, they will not have those changes in, since the patch will only be installed once the
app is open for the first time. This might cause users to download an outdated app "out of the box".

### My update contains changes in native code

If your update contains changes in the native code, like a new plugin, or even some custom code
added to the platform folder, these changes will not "arrive" at the users through patches, since
that is not supported by Shorebird. So in these cases a new release is required.

### My update contains assets changes

If the update contains new assets, or changed an existing one, like an image, a font file, etc. A
new release is needed since the update of those are not supported in patches.

This is likely to change in the future, use this
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318) to follow up on the progress.

# When to send patches

### Bug fixes

Patches can only contain dart code changes, it doesn't matter if the changes were made directly
in the application source, or if it is a change in the dart code of a package/plugin that the app
depends on.

The most common and best fit scenario that patches are meant for, are changes that would fix a bug
in the app, a fix that don't change a feature behavior, but rather just add a correction to a fault
code affecting users.

### Small changes

Small changes that are not fixing a bug, but just changing a small detail in the app can also be a
good fit for a patch. Things like changing the wording in a header or label, a small layout change,
etc.

It is just important to not overuse though, sending many small changes too frequently could be seen
by the stores as "dodging" app reviews, which might cause app rejection.
