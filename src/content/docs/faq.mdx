Still have a question about Shorebird that our docs didn't cover? You’re in the
right place. This page covers the most common questions and issues. Still stuck?
Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) or
[file an issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues). We’re here
to help.

## Getting Started

### What is the difference between a patch and a release?

We use the term "release" to mean preparing a binary for the app stores. In
order to later generate a patch Shorebird needs to know the exact binary that
was shipped to the app stores. The `shorebird release` command is used to
prepare a binary for the app stores which includes the Shorebird updater.

We use the term "patch" to mean a binary that can be applied to a release to
update it to new code. The `shorebird patch` command is used to generate a patch
from your new local code which is then diffed with the release binary to
generate a patch which is then shipped to your users.

We explain more of these terms in [Overview](/code-push/overview).

### When should I create a patch vs a release?

Because patching and releasing are independent operations, it is possible to
create both a patch and a release with the same code changes.

:::note

A "release" gets a unique release version, while a "patch" does not change the
release version, just the "patch number". The "release version" is a store
concept, where as "patch number" is a Shorebird concept. Apps can read the
current patch version at runtime via the
[package:shorebird_code_push](https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push).

:::

Different customers have used different policies to decide whether to create a
release, a patch, or both. Some of these polices include:

1. Push a patch immediately to update all existing users, while also
   simultaneously submitting a release to the stores so that new users to their
   product will get the latest code on first launch after a store install.

2. Use patching as a mechanism to ship changes on a high frequency (e.g. daily
   or weekly) and only go through a full release process on a lower cadence
   (e.g. monthly).

3. Continue to only use releases for shipping code changes, and only patch to
   fix critical bugs or make other emergency changes.

In the end, it comes down to what works for your business. We see most of our
current customers choosing option 2.

:::note

Changes which involve native code cannot be patched and thus must use a release
for distribution.

:::

### Can I use Shorebird from my CI system?

Yes. Shorebird is intended to be used from CI systems. We've published a
[generic guide for CI setup](/code-push/ci/generic/) as well as other CI
systems.

### Can I use Dart defines with Shorebird?

Yes. The `shorebird` command line tool passes through all Dart defines to the
`flutter` tool. For example,
`shorebird release android -- --dart-define=MY_DEFINE=foo` and
`shorebird release android -- --dart-define-from-file=config.json` will both
work as expected. Because Dart defines are compiled into your app's Dart code,
they can be updated via patches.

### How does Shorebird relate to Flutter?

Shorebird is a fork of Flutter that adds code push. Shorebird is not a
replacement for Flutter, but rather a replacement for the Flutter engine. You
can continue to use the Flutter tooling you already know and love.

`shorebird` uses a fork of Flutter that includes the Shorebird updater. We track
the latest stable release of Flutter and replace a few of the Flutter engine
files with our modified copies.

To implement our fork, we use `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to point to
`https://download.shorebird.dev` instead of download.flutter.dev. We pass
through unmodified output from the `flutter` tool so you will see a warning from
Flutter:

```
Flutter assets will be downloaded from http://download.shorebird.dev. Make sure you trust this source!
```

For more information about why we had to fork Flutter see
[System Architecture](/code-push/system-architecture).

### What platforms does Shorebird support?

Shorebird supports
[Android, iOS](https://shorebird.dev/blog/1.0/)[, Mac, Windows, and Linux](https://shorebird.dev/blog/desktop-in-production/).

Use of Shorebird on each platform is an independent decision. For example You
can use `shorebird release` to ship to Google Play and an ipa built with
`flutter build` to the App Store or vice versa.

### What OS versions does Shorebird support?

Shorebird supports the same versions of platforms that Flutter supports. You can
find the details of this on the
[Flutter Docs site](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms).

### What versions of Flutter does Shorebird support?

For specific versions by platform please consult out
[Flutter Version Management](/getting-started/flutter-version/) page.

Shorebird tracks Flutter stable and generally updates within a few hours of any
stable release. Our system for doing these updates is automated. We then do an
extra manual verification step before publishing to our servers.

## Store Compliance

### Does Shorebird comply with Play Store guidelines?

Yes.

The Play Store offers two restrictions relating to update tools.

1.  Updates must use an interpreter or virtual machine (Shorebird uses the Dart
    Virtual Machine).
    https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379?hl=en

```
    An app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself
    using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism. Likewise, an app
    may not download executable code (such as dex, JAR, .so files) from a
    source other than Google Play. *This restriction does not apply to code
    that runs in a virtual machine or an interpreter* where either provides
    indirect access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or
    browser).

    Apps or third-party code, like SDKs, with interpreted languages (JavaScript,
    Python, Lua, etc.) loaded at run time (for example, not packaged with the
    app) must not allow potential violations of Google Play policies.
```

2.  Changes to the app must not be deceptive (e.g. changing the purpose of the
    app via update).
    https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077
    Please be clear with your users about what you are providing with your
    application and do not violate their expectations with significant
    behavioral changes through the use of Shorebird.

Shorebird is designed to be compatible with the Play Store guidelines. However
Shorebird is a tool, and as with any tool, can be abused. Deliberately abusing
Shorebird to violate Play Store guidelines is in violation of the Shorebird
[Terms of Service](https://shorebird.dev/terms) and can result in termination of
your account.

Code push services are widely used in the industry (all of the large apps I'm
aware of use them) and there are multiple other code push services publicly
available (e.g. expo.dev & appcenter.ms). This is a well trodden path.

Microsoft also publishes a guide on how their React Native "codepush" library
complies with the app stores:
https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance

### Does Shorebird comply with App Store guidelines?

Yes.

Similar to the Play Store, the App Store offers both technical and policy
restrictions.

```
3.3.1b
... interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application but only so long as
such code:
(a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing
features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and
advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store,
(b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and
(c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS.
```

Shorebird uses a custom Dart interpreter to comply with the interpreter-only
restriction for updates on iOS. So long as your application is not engaging in
deceptive behavior via updates (e.g. changing the purpose of the app via
update), updating via Shorebird (or any other code push solution) is standard
industry practice and compliant with
[App Store guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/#b331).

Deliberately abusing Shorebird to violate App Store guidelines is in violation
of the Shorebird [Terms of Service](https://shorebird.dev/terms) and can result
in termination of your account.

Microsoft also publishes a guide on how their react native "codepush" library
complies with the app stores:
https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance

### Now that I'm using Shorebird, do I still need to send my app to the stores?

Yes. We recommend customers continue to release their app through the stores in
addition to using Shorebird. Even if this now means that there can be less
pressure on your app release process.

This is for two reasons:

1. Stores have policy restrictions that "major new features" go through store
   review to avoid "deceiving users". Since apps are likely to change over time,
   periodic releases (to update store screenshots, etc.) is still good practice.
2. New users install from the stores, not Shorebird. Shorebird can only update
   your application after launch, so for users to get the best first-launch
   experience, we recommend that you continue to periodic releases to the
   stores.

### Does Shorebird submit to the stores for me?

Shorebird does not currently support submitting to the app stores on your
behalf. We may end up adding this in the future, but for now you will need to
continue to use your existing processes to submit to the app stores.

## Use Cases & Limitations

### What can I use Shorebird code push for?

We've seen a variety of uses, including:

- Emergency fixes to production apps.
- Shipping bug fixes to users on older versions of your app.
- Shipping constantly (e.g. daily, every commit to `main`, etc).

Note that most app stores prohibit shipping code that changes the behavior of
the app in a significant way. Please see our
[Store Compliance section](#store-compliance) for more information.

### What can't we use Shorebird code push for?

Shorebird does not support changing native code (e.g. Java/Kotlin on Android or
Objective-C/Swift on iOS). The tool will warn you during an attempted patch if
you have changed native code.

Shorebird should not be used to violate app store polices. Please see our
[Store Compliance section](#store-compliance) for more information.

### Can I use Shorebird for all my Dart changes?

Shorebird can be used to update any Dart code including pure Dart packages. Note
that depending on how you distribute your apps, some store agreements expect
feature changes to go through store review. Notably Apple's App Store requires
that an update "does not change the primary purpose of the Application by
providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and
advertised purpose of the Application." Also note that patch sizes correlate
with the total amount of Dart changed from the original released app. Each patch
is a diff against the released dart code, not a diff to the previous patch.

### How does this relate to Firebase Remote Config or Launch Darkly?

Code push allows adding new code / replacing code on the device. Firebase Remote
Config and Launch Darkly are both configuration systems. They allow you to
change the configuration of your app without having to ship a new version. They
are not intended to replace code.

### How does this relate to Flutter Hot Reload?

Flutter's Hot reload is a development-time-only feature. Code push is for
production.

Hot reload is a feature of Flutter that allows you to change code on the device
during development. It requires building the Flutter engine with a debug-mode
Dart VM which includes a just-in-time (JIT) Dart compiler.

Code push is a feature that allows you to change code on the device in
production. We will use a variety of different techniques to make this possible
depending on the platform. Current demos execute ahead-of-time compiled Dart
code and do not require a JIT Dart compiler.

### Does Shorebird support Flutter Web?

Code push isn't needed for Flutter web. When a user opens a web app it downloads
the latest version from the server if needed.

If you have a use case for code push with Fluter web, we'd
[love to know](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev)!

## Technical Details

### What does the Shorebird updater store on disk?

The Shorebird updater (included in your application when you build your app with
Shorebird) caches the latest downloaded patch in the same cache directory that
Flutter uses for caching compiled shaders or compiled Dart code. On Android,
this is located in `/data/user/0/com.example.app/code_cache/shorebird_updater`
although the base of that path is provided by the Android system and can change
dynamically at runtime. On iOS devices, data is stored under
`Library/Application Support/shorebird`.

Shorebird stores only a few files, one is `state.json` which contains the state
information for the updater. When a patch is downloaded a directory will be
created for that patch. These directories contain the inflated copies of the
patches, which will be about the same size as the compiled Dart code in your
application (e.g. ~10 mb each). There will only be at most 2 patches downloaded
on the device at a given time. When a new patch is successfully installed and
launched, the previous patch is deleted.

### What do the Shorebird tools store on disk?

The Shorebird command line tools (e.g. `shorebird patch`) are installed on disk
in `$HOME/.shorebird`, including bringing a copy of Flutter and Dart as well as
the Shorebird release tools themselves. This is similar to how the `flutter`
command works.

These copies of Flutter can be 100s of megabytes each. Shorebird will keep a
copy of Flutter `$HOME/.shorebird/bin/cache/` for each version of Flutter you
have used. Currently this number is unbounded. These can be removed at any time
with `shorebird cache clear`.

[Uninstall](/code-push/uninstall) has details on how to remove Shorebird from
your system should you choose.

### How big of a dependency footprint does this add?

We expect the code push library to add less than one megabyte to Flutter apps.
`flutter build apk --release` vs. `shorebird build apk --release` should give
you a rough idea but keep in mind that many store distributions do also
automatically thin your app for the device that it is being installed on.

### When do updates happen?

By default, the Shorebird updater checks for updates on app startup. It runs on
a background thread and does not block the UI thread. Any updates will be
installed while the user is using the app and will be applied the next time the
app is restarted.

It is also possible to run the Shorebird updater manually using
[package:shorebird_code_push](https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push),
through which it is possible to trigger updates at any time, including via a
push notification.

See [Update Strategies](/code-push/update-strategies) for more information about
how to configure this behavior.

### What information is sent to Shorebird servers?

Although Shorebird connects to the network, it does not send any personally
identifiable information (PII). Including Shorebird should not affect your
declarations for the Play Store or App Store.

Requests sent from the app to Shorebird servers include:

- app_id (specified `shorebird.yaml`)
- channel (optional in `shorebird.yaml`)
- release_version (versionName from AndroidManifest.xml)
- patch_number (generated as part of `shorebird patch android`)
- arch (e.g. 'aarch64', needed to send down the right patch)
- platform (e.g. 'android', needed to send down the right patch)

The code for this is public in our
[updater package](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater/blob/main/library/src/network.rs)
and can be reviewed at any time.

### Do I need to keep my app_id secret?

No. The `app_id` is included in your app and is safe to be public. You can check
it into version control (even publicly) and not worry about someone else
accessing it.

Someone who has your `app_id` can fetch the latest version of your app from
Shorebird servers, but they cannot push updates to your app or access any other
aspect of your Shorebird account.

### Does code push require the internet to work?

Yes. Some form of network connectivity is required to transport updates to the
devices.

### How is Shorebird affected by lack of network connectivity?

The Shorebird updater is designed to be resilient to network connectivity
issues.

In the default update behavior, when the application launches it alerts the
Shorebird updater, which spawns a separate thread to make a network request to
Shorebird's servers and ask for an update. We intentionally use a separate
thread to avoid affecting blocking anything else the application might be doing.
If the network request fails or times out, the updater will simply try to check
again next time the application launches.

Shorebird command line tools (e.g. `shorebird patch`) require network
connectivity to function. If you are using Shorebird to distribute your app, you
should ensure that your CI system has network connectivity.

### What happens if a user doesn't update for a long time?

A user will always get the latest patch available for their version of the app,
regardless of which patch (if any) they currently have installed. A patch will
always reflect the state of the codebase at the time when the patch was built so
as long as newer patches also contain the changes from older patches, users will
always be up to date and there is no need to worry about users "missing"
patches.

## Teams, Access, and Privacy

### Can I use Shorebird with my team?

Yes! The Shorebird free "Hobby" tier only supports a single developer, but all
other plans support unlimited developers.

See [Organizations](/account/orgs) for more information.

### Can I self-host Shorebird?

No. Shorebird has no current plans to offer on-prem, self-host or cloud-prem
offerings. We would be happy to discuss with you any and all ways in which we
can improve our centrally hosted solution to best match your needs.

### Does code push work with large applications?

Yes. There is no limit on the size of the application that can be patched with
code push. As noted in
[Overview](/code-push/overview#what-types-of-changes-can-be-included-in-a-patch),
Shorebird can change any Dart code in your application no matter of size.

### Does Shorebird store my source code?

No. Shorebird servers never see or store your source code. When you run
`shorebird release` or `shorebird patch` the `shorebird` tool only uploads the
same compiled app binary that you send to the app stores.

### Will my app still work if I cancel my Shorebird subscription?

Yes. Apps built with Shorebird will continue to function normally (as if they
had been built without Shorebird), including those that have had patches
installed.

### Can I use Shorebird in my country?

We have not attempted to restrict access to Shorebird from any country.

We recognize that some countries have restrictions on what urls can be accessed
from within the country. Shorebird currently uses Google Cloud for hosting,
including Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Run.

The following URLs are used by Shorebird:

- https://console.shorebird.dev -- used to interact with Shorebird's services
  via the web.
- https://api.shorebird.dev -- used by the `shorebird` command line tools to
  interact with the Shorebird servers as well as the Shorebird updater on users'
  devices to check for updates.
- https://download.shorebird.dev -- used by the `shorebird` command line tool to
  download Flutter artifacts for building releases and patches.
- https://storage.googleapis.com -- used by the `shorebird` command line tool to
  upload and download release and patch artifacts, and by the Shorebird updater
  on user's devices to download the patches.
- https://cdn.shorebird.cloud/ -- used by the Shorebird updater when downloading
  patches to a user's device.

Shorebird also uses Microsoft or Google OAuth login, which have their own
required urls for login (e.g. login.microsoftonline.com or oauth.google.com).

All traffic to and from Shorebird servers travels over https (port 443) and is
encrypted using standard Transport Security Layer / Secure Sockets Layer
(TSL/SSL) protocols.

If all of those URLs are accessible from your country, then Shorebird should
work.

If your region requires use of
[FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL](https://docs.flutter.dev/community/china) Shorebird
may not work for you at this time as we also use that environment variable as
part of our implementation. We have plans to
[remove this restriction](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/435)
in the future.

### Do I need to distribute my app through a store?

No. Shorebird can be used with any app distribution method, including
side-loading or carrier provided stores.

Shorebird is not itself a store. Your users will need to install your app
initially through some method other than Shorebird, but Shorebird can then be
used to patch (update) your app after that initial install.

### How does Shorebird interact with Play Testing Tracks or Apple TestFlight?

Each of the app stores have separate mechanisms for distributing apps to limited
groups of users (e.g. "internal testing", "closed beta", etc.). These are all
mechanisms for segmenting your users into groups and distributing specific
versions of your apps to each.

Unfortunately, these not all of these mechanisms allow 3rd parties to detect
when apps are installed in any specific Test Track or via TestFlight. Thus, we
do not have reliable visibility into composition of these groups, and cannot
reliably gate access to Shorebird patches based on these groups. You can read a
bit more about this on Stack Overflow discussions specifically about
[Android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53291007/can-an-android-application-identify-the-test-track-within-google-play)
and
[iOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26081543/how-to-tell-at-runtime-whether-an-ios-app-is-running-through-a-testflight-beta-i).

If you'd like to segment availability of Shorebird patches, there are some
potential options:

- Use separate binaries / bundle ids for each group. This is the most
  straightforward approach, but requires you to manage multiple binaries. On
  Android the easy way to accomplish this is through flavors. You may already
  have a dev flavor and prod flavor with different availability. You can thus
  patch your dev flavor, verify it and then separately patch your prod flavor.
  We recommend using branches / tags in your version control to help keep track
  of the sources associated with each release.
- Track your own set of opt-in users, disable automatic updates, and trigger
  updates only for certain users via
  [package:shorebird_code_push](https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push).
  This requires you to manage your own opt-in list.

https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects

Our team also operates in the public, so you can see what we're working on at
any time. We're happy to answer any questions you have about our roadmap or
priorities via GitHub issues or [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird).

## Scenario Based Troubleshooting

### Shorebird fails to install

This can happen on Windows due to Windows' limit of 260 characters for a
filename.

You can fix this by running:

```sh
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

You may need to run this as an administrator, and you will need to restart your
terminal after running this command.

### Patch not showing up

Your first step in debugging should be to check your app's logs. Instructions
for this can be found at https://shorebird.dev/blog/viewing-logs/.

You should see logs prefixed with `[shorebird]`. If you do not see `[shorebird]`
in your logs, the app you are running was not built using `shorebird release`
and cannot receive patches. You will need to redistribute your app using a
binary created by `shorebird release`.

If you do see Shorebird in your logs, you'll want to look for a a line that
includes the patch check request being made. It looks like:

```
Sending patch check request: PatchCheckRequest {
  app_id: "<your app id>",
  channel: "stable",
  release_version: "1.0.3+16", <-- this is the release version
  patch_number: <some patch number>,
  platform: "android",
  arch: "aarch64"
}
```

If the release version is the version you expect to see, check the
[Shorebird Console](https://console.shorebird.dev) to ensure that this release
exists for the given app id and that it has a patch. Please contact us on
Discord if such a patch exists and is not being applied.

Common issues:

**The patch was created for a different release version than the one running on
your device/emulator.**

Patches are only compatible with the release version they were created for. If
you create a patch for version `1.0.0+1`, it will not work on version `1.0.0+2`.

:::note

This can happen unexpectedly on iOS due to Xcode's automatic incrementing of
build numbers. If you are seeing this issue on iOS, ensure that the build number
of the release and the patch match. See
[our iOS releasing guide](/code-push/guides/stores/app-store/#upload-to-the-app-store)
for instructions on how to disable automatic build number incrementing.

:::

**How to tell if this is the problem**

You will see `Shorebird updater: no active patch` in your device logs.

**How to fix it**

Ensure that the version of your app on your device/emulator matches the version
of the release you patched. You can see what release version your app is running
by looking in the device logs for a patch check request:

```
Sending patch check request: PatchCheckRequest {
  app_id: "<your app id>",
  channel: "stable",
  release_version: "1.0.3+16", <-- this is the release version
  patch_number: <some patch number>,
  platform: "android",
  arch: "aarch64"
}
```

Only patches created for this release version will be compatible with your app.

### Can't run my app in VS Code

If you see error output like the following when using the Run or Debug button in
VS Code:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:checkDebugAarMetadata'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugRuntimeClasspath'.
   > Could not find io.flutter:arm64_v8a_debug:1.0.0-4a5e8142f3e7368a48e4f6151cb7b1a684d6dd83.
     Searched in the following locations:
```

It's possible that VS Code is incorrectly using Shorebird's version of Flutter
instead of the Flutter on your path (see
https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4607). You can fix this by
explicitly providing VS Code with the path to your Flutter installation. In your
`settings.json` file, add the line:

```json
"dart.flutterSdkPath": "/path/to/flutter"
```

Where "/path/to/flutter" is the path to your Flutter installation. You can get
this by running `which flutter` in your terminal (or `where.exe flutter` on
Windows) and removing the `/bin/flutter` from the end of that path.

### Could not find an option named "dart define"

This typically happens on Windows when using the `--` separator. Powershell
handles the `--` separator differently than other shells (see
[this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15788023) for more
info). To work around this, you can quote the `--` separator. For example:

```sh
shorebird release android '--' --dart-define=foo=bar
```

### My iOS build number is auto incrementing

This is likely because you are providing an export options .plist file that sets
`manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber` to true. This is incompatible with Shorebird
because Shorebird requires that you maintain control over your app's version and
build numbers in order to target patches at specific releases. You can fix this
problem by either setting `manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber` to false or removing
the value from your export options .plist file.

### `Your app contains asset changes` warning when creating a patch

The `shorebird patch` command will print a warning if it detects changes to
files in your compiled app that correspond to asset changes (e.g. added or
removed images, fonts, etc.). This does not always mean that your patch will not
work, but shorebird cannot be sure that the changes are safe.

Shorebird does not (yet) have the
[ability to patch assets](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318)
but intends to add such in the future, at which time this warning may go away.

An example of this warning:

```
✓ Verifying patch can be applied to release (4.0s)
[WARN] The release artifact contains asset changes, which will not be included in the patch.
    Added files:
        base/assets/flutter_assets/assets/images/bg_button_disable.png
    Changed files:
        base/assets/flutter_assets/AssetManifest.bin
        base/assets/flutter_assets/AssetManifest.json
        base/assets/flutter_assets/fonts/MaterialIcons-Regular.otf
Continue anyways? (y/N)
```

So what does this mean? In this case, it means you added a new image to my app.
The warning is because my patched Dart code could _depend_ on those new assets
which will not be present when the patch is applied in the wild. It can be safe
to ignore this kind of warning if you're removing an asset that is not used by
your code, or your Dart code knows how to handle the asset being missing.

Also included in the above changes are the `AssetManifest` files. These files
change any time you add or remove an asset from your app, and are generally a
symptom rather than the cause of the warning.

The final file changed above is the `MaterialIcons-Regular.otf` font file, which
can happen if your app uses more or fewer icons from the Dart code. Flutter will
automatically "tree shake" your fonts, so if you don't use an icon in your Dart
code, it will not be included in the final app. You can disable this behavior
with `--no-tree-shake-icons` at the risk of increasing your app size. This type
of warning will also go away once we add
[asset patching](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318).

A type of change not shown above is one which changes .dex files on Android or
the `Runner.app` directory on iOS. These changes represent changes to the native
code of your app, and are not patchable by Shorebird. If you see this warning,
you should be very careful about publishing your patch, as it may cause your app
to crash when the Dart code tries to call into native code which operates
differently than expected.

**What happens if I ignore this warning?**

You can bypass this warning by passing the `--allow-asset-diffs` flag to the
`shorebird patch` command.

The consequences of ignoring this warning depend on the changes that were made.
In the tree-shaking example above, if you ignore the warning, your app will
render incorrectly if you use an icon that was not included in the release
build. Any assets introduced in a patch will fail to load and your app may crash
if it depends on them.

If you are not sure whether your change is safe, you can
[stage your patch](/code-push/guides/staging-patches) and test locally before
deploying it to users.

#### `Your app contains native changes` warning when creating a patch, even though you haven't changed Swift/Objective-C/Kotlin/Java code

The `shorebird patch` command will print a warning if it detects changes to
files in your compiled app that correspond to native code changes (`.dex` files
on Android, files in the `Runner.app` directory on iOS). This does not always
mean that your patch will not work, but because shorebird cannot be sure that
the changes are safe, and because shorebird can't patch non-Dart code, it prints
a warning.

:::note

Shorebird assumes a repeatable build -- if you build the application twice it
ends up byte-for-byte identical (with a few minor known exceptions, like the
certificate signing date for iOS apps). Some Flutter Plugins or obfuscation
solutions violate this assumption and can cause these native changes to appear.
Shorebird may be incompatible with those plugins. You can test for this by doing
a `shorebird release` and then `shorebird patch` with no changes and seeing if
you still get a native changes warning. If you believe this is the case please
reach out to us, we'd be happy to help!

:::

This can be caused by a number of things. The most common causes are:

1. A dependency/plugin you are using has changed its native code. **You should
   use caution when publishing patches that include changes to native code from
   plugins. In the worst case, these changes may cause your patched app to
   crash.**

   :::tip

   Add your `pubspec.lock` file to version control so you're always aware of
   updates to your dependencies.

   Versioning your `pubspec.lock` file ensures changes to transitive
   dependencies are explicit. Each time the dependencies change due to
   `dart pub upgrade` or a change in `pubspec.yaml`, the difference will be
   apparent in the lock file.

   :::

2. A dependency/plugin produces a different output on every build. This can
   happen if the dependency it includes a timestamp indicating when it was
   built, for example. This kind of change is usually safe to publish, but you
   should be sure this is the only reason you are seeing this warning.
3. (iOS only) The release was built with a different version of Xcode than the
   patch. This can be fixed by ensuring that you are using the same version of
   Xcode to build the release and the patch. If you've upgraded to a newer
   version of Xcode since building the release, you can download older versions
   of Xcode from
   [Apple's developer downloads page](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).
4. (iOS only) You are building with an old version of Xcode. Specifically, we've
   seen this warning when building with Xcode 14.1. If you are using a version
   of Xcode that is not the latest, try upgrading to the latest version.
5. The version and build number of the patch do not match that of the release.
   For example, if the release was built with version `1.0.0+1`, but the patch
   was generated with version `1.0.0+2`, you might see this warning. We have
   implemented some safeguards to make this less likely, but it's worth
   verifying if you're seeing this warning and you don't know why.

**What happens if I ignore this warning?**

:::danger

If the changes are to native code that interacts with your Flutter app or with
Flutter itself, **your app will crash**.

:::

If the native code that changed does not interact with your Dart code or Flutter
at all, the patch should run without issue.

If you are not sure whether your change is safe, you can
[stage your patch](/code-push/guides/staging-patches) and test locally before
deploying it to users.

If you are sure the changes are safe, you can bypass this warning by passing the
`--allow-native-diffs` flag to the `shorebird patch` command.

### Invalid Podfile file

You might see this error message if the `FLUTTER_ROOT` definition in your
project's `ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig` points to a Shorebird Flutter
installation. This can be fixed by running any of:

1. `flutter clean`, or
1. `flutter build ios` in your project's root directory, or
1. `flutter run` in your project's root directory and targeting an iOS
   simulator/device.

### Unsupported class file major version 65

The error `Unsupported class file major version 65` (or 66—the number varies
sometimes) happens when gradle is being executed with an incompatible Java
version.

You can check the specific Gradle version that your app is using by running
`shorebird doctor -v` inside the project folder. This command will also print
the java version that shorebird is using.

Refer to the
[official Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)
to check which Java version works with which Gradle release.

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) comes with a bundled
  JDK which should be auto detected by Shorebird and might be the easiest way of
  solving the issue.
- If in a GitHub Action, the [setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
  action can help.
- Or try Installing the required Java version for your project's Gradle release
  and set the path where it was installed in the `JAVA_HOME` environment
  variable.

### Missing a provisioning profile or no signing team was found

We address this issue in our [releasing guide](/code-push/release). Take a look
at the iOS section for more information.

### Message saying patch might run slowly

iOS uses a very different patching process than Android does. The details of
which are described in [Architecture docs](/code-push/system-architecture). We
also talk about this in our [Patch Performance](/code-push/performance) page as
well.
