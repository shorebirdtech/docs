Flutter 3.41 is the latest stable release as of February 2026, bundled with Dart
3.11, and installing it correctly from day one, alongside
[Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/) for over-the-air updates, eliminates the
most common developer pain points, such as broken PATH variables, missing
Android SDK command-line tools, and CocoaPods failures on Apple Silicon.

This guide covers exact commands and configuration for macOS, Windows, and
Linux, prioritizing the professional workflow used in production teams. macOS
remains the only platform that can target all six Flutter output formats (iOS,
Android, web, macOS desktop, Windows via cross-compilation, and Linux), making
it the dominant choice for mobile development shops.

---

## System requirements and prerequisites across all platforms

Flutter's SDK weighs approximately 2.8 GB on disk, but a realistic production
setup, including Android SDK, emulator images, and an IDE, requires 10 GB or
more of free space. The
[official docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) do not specify a
hard RAM floor, but community consensus and practical experience put the minimum
at 8 GB, with 16 GB strongly recommended when running Android emulators or iOS
simulators alongside an IDE.

Every platform requires Git 2.x as a prerequisite. On macOS, Git ships with
[Xcode Command-Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/). On
Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). On
Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install git` handles it. Verify with `git --version`
before proceeding.

Here's a quick rundown of the requirements for each platform:

| Requirement    | macOS                                       | Windows                           | Linux (Ubuntu LTS)                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS version** | macOS 10.15 Catalina through macOS 26 Tahoe | 64-bit Windows 10 or 11           | 64-bit Debian-based or Fedora                      |
| **Disk space** | 10 GB+ recommended                          | 10 GB+ recommended                | 10 GB+ recommended                                 |
| **RAM**        | 8 GB min, 16 GB ideal                       | 8 GB min, 16 GB ideal             | 8 GB recommended                                   |
| **Git**        | Via Xcode CLI tools                         | Git for Windows                   | `apt-get install git`                              |
| **Additional** | Xcode, CocoaPods                            | Visual Studio 2022+ (for desktop) | `curl`, `unzip`, `xz-utils`, `zip`, `libglu1-mesa` |

Flutter bundles the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart), no separate Dart
installation is needed.

Always use the stable channel for production work. Four stable releases are
[planned for 2026](https://blog.flutter.dev/whats-new-in-flutter-3-41-302ec140e632#:~:text=For%202026%2C%20we%20plan%20to%20release%20four%20stable%20releases).

---

## macOS installation

macOS setup carries the most complexity because it's the only platform
supporting both iOS and Android development simultaneously. The single biggest
architectural decision is whether you're on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) or
Intel, because [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) install paths, Ruby environments,
and emulator image choices all differ.

### Installing the Flutter SDK

The fastest method is Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask flutter
```

Homebrew automatically selects the correct architecture. On Apple Silicon,
Homebrew lives at `/opt/homebrew/`; on Intel, it's at `/usr/local/`.

If you prefer manual installation, download the architecture-specific zip from
the
[Flutter SDK archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/archive#stable-channel).
Apple Silicon uses the `flutter_macos_arm64_*.zip` bundle and Intel uses
`flutter_macos_*.zip`.

Once downloaded, extract the zip to a development directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/develop
unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_arm64_3.41.0-stable.zip -d ~/develop/
```

For manual installs, add Flutter to your PATH. Since macOS defaults to **zsh**
(since Catalina), edit `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="\$HOME/develop/flutter/bin:\$PATH"
```

For bash users, add the same line to `~/.bash_profile`. Apple Silicon users also
need Homebrew's shell environment configured:

```bash
eval "\$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Intel users must substitute `/usr/local/bin/brew`. You can verify your Flutter
CLI installation with the `which flutter` and `flutter --version` commands.

### Xcode and iOS toolchain

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the Mac App Store
(Flutter 3.38+ fully supports Xcode 26 and iOS 26), then run these commands in
sequence:

```bash
xcode-select --install
sudo sh -c 'xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer && xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch'
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
```

### CocoaPods: the Apple Silicon pain point

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) remains required for Flutter plugins that
use native iOS/macOS code, and it is the single most common source of build
failures on Apple Silicon.

Here's how to install CocoaPods via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cocoapods
```

Typically, the system Ruby shipped with macOS (2.6.x) is too old. Therefore, you
could install a modern Ruby first and then install CocoaPods via gem if the
first option doesn't work:

```bash
brew install ruby
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:\$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
gem install cocoapods
```

If you encounter `ffi` gem errors on Apple Silicon, run `sudo gem install ffi`.
[Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) may still be needed for
some edge-case components. To install that, run
`sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`.

Also, never use `sudo gem install` with the system Ruby. It can corrupt future
macOS updates.

A notable 2025–2026 development: _Swift Package Manager_ is now supported as an
alternative to CocoaPods for Flutter plugins, documented in the
[Flutter Swift Package Manager guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers).

## Windows and Linux installation procedures

### Windows 10/11 setup

After installing Git for Windows, the Flutter team recommends the VS Code
quick-install path:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Add the Flutter extension
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
4. Type `Flutter: New Project`, and VS Code will prompt you to download the SDK
   and add it to PATH automatically.

For manual installation, download the latest `.zip` from the
[Flutter SDK archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/archive#stable-channel)
and extract it to a path without spaces or special characters (as a reminder,
never use `C:\Program Files\`). A good choice is `%USERPROFILE%\develop\`:

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path \$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\flutter_windows_3.41.0-stable.zip -Destination \$env:USERPROFILE\develop\
```

Next, to add Flutter to your path, configure PATH through **System Properties →
Advanced → Environment Variables**. Edit the `Path` user variable and add
`C:\Users\{username}\develop\flutter\bin`. Move this entry to the top of the
list. Once done, close and reopen all terminal windows to ensure the new path
gets applied.

Three Windows-specific gotchas trip up nearly every developer.

First, Windows Defender scanning Flutter's hundreds of thousands of small files
causes severe performance degradation. To avoid this, add exclusions for the
Flutter SDK directory and the pub cache (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache`):

```powershell
Add-MpExclusion -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\{username}\develop\flutter"
```

Second, Developer Mode must be enabled for building Windows apps with plugins
(**Settings → Privacy & Security → For Developers → Developer Mode: On**).

Third, for Windows desktop development, you need
[Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the
"Desktop development with C++" workload. Remember, this is Visual Studio, not VS
Code.

---

### Linux (Ubuntu LTS) setup

To get started, install required dependencies first:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
```

The simplest method to install Flutter is via **snap**:

```bash
sudo snap install flutter --classic
```

If you want to install Flutter, manually, download the `.tar.xz` from the
[SDK archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive) and extract:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/develop
tar -xf ~/Downloads/flutter_linux_3.41.0-stable.tar.xz -C ~/develop/
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH="\$HOME/develop/flutter/bin:\$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For Linux desktop development, additional packages are required as documented in
the
[Flutter Linux desktop setup guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/setup):

```bash
sudo apt-get install clang cmake git ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libstdc++-12-dev
```

> Never run Flutter commands with `sudo` on Linux, as this can create permission
> issues that are painful to unwind.

---

## Android SDK setup

Regardless of your operating system, the Android toolchain is where most
`flutter doctor` failures occur.

To get started, install the latest Android Studio from the
[Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio). During the
setup wizard, Android Studio installs the base SDK. But the wizard does not
install everything Flutter needs.

To do that, open the SDK Manager (Android Studio → **Tools** →**SDK Manager**,
or from the welcome screen: **More Actions** → **SDK Manager**). You need to
configure two tabs:

1. In the **SDK Platforms** tab, install the platform for **API Level 36**
   (Android 16).
2. In the **SDK Tools** tab (this is the critical step that most guides gloss
   over) ensure all four of these are checked:
   - **Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)**, the #1 most common missing
     component
   - **Android SDK Build-Tools** (latest)
   - **Android SDK Platform-Tools** (includes `adb`)
   - **Android Emulator**

Click **Apply** and confirm.

> Without the command-line tools specifically, `flutter doctor` will fail with:
> `cmdline-tools component is missing`.

### Environment variables for the Android SDK

Set `ANDROID_HOME` and add platform-tools to PATH. The default SDK locations
differ by OS:

**macOS** (`~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="\$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export PATH="\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"
export PATH="\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
export PATH="\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/emulator"
```

**Windows** (System Environment Variables):

- Variable: `ANDROID_HOME` = `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`
- Add to PATH: `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` and
  `%ANDROID_HOME%\cmdline-tools\latest\bin`

**Linux** (`~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="\$HOME/Android/Sdk"
export PATH="\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"
export PATH="\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
```

After configuring the SDK, accept all Android licenses:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Type `y` at each prompt. This step is mandatory before Flutter can build any
Android app.

## Shorebird CLI belongs in your initial setup, not as an afterthought

[Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/), founded by Flutter creator Eric Seidel,
enables over-the-air code push, pushing Dart code updates directly to users'
devices without App Store or Play Store review cycles.

Installing it alongside Flutter from day one avoids the common "retrofit under
pressure" scenario where teams scramble to add OTA capability while rushing to
fix a production bug. [Patches](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/patch/) are
tied to exact release versions, so having Shorebird configured early prevents
version-matching headaches.

### Installation commands

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
iwr -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.ps1' | iex
```

Shorebird installs to `~/.shorebird/bin` and automatically adds itself to PATH.
It also installs a private copy of Flutter inside
`~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`, this is Shorebird's modified Flutter for code
push and should **not** be added to your PATH. The total installation size is
approximately **300 MB**.

You can verify the installation by running this:

```bash
shorebird --version
shorebird doctor
```

The `shorebird doctor` output checks connectivity to Shorebird's API, console,
OAuth, storage, and CDN endpoints, and verifies that the Flutter installation is
correct. A clean output should look like this:

```
✓ https://api.shorebird.dev OK
✓ https://console.shorebird.dev OK
✓ Shorebird is up-to-date
✓ Flutter install is correct
No issues detected!
```

The core workflow to get started is:

1. `shorebird login` (authenticates via Google OAuth)
2. [Initialize your project](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/initialize/)
   with `shorebird init` (creates `shorebird.yaml` with your app ID)
3. [Create a release](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/release/) with
   `shorebird release android` or `shorebird release ios`,
4. [Push OTA updates](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/patch/) with
   `shorebird patch android/ios`.

The [`shorebird create` command](https://shorebird.dev/blog/shorebird-create/)
scaffolds new projects with OTA, CI/CD, and release tooling baked in from the
start.

Shorebird is purely CLI-driven and works seamlessly alongside the standard
Flutter and Dart VS Code extensions.

## VS Code configuration for professional Flutter development

Install the **Flutter extension** (ID: `Dart-Code.flutter`) from the VS Code
marketplace. It automatically installs the **Dart extension**
(`Dart-Code.dart-code`) as a dependency. These two extensions provide debugging,
hot reload, widget inspector, code completion, refactoring, and snippets.

After installation, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run
`Dart: Use Recommended Settings` to apply sensible defaults, or add these to
your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "[dart]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.formatOnType": true,
    "editor.rulers": [80],
    "editor.selectionHighlight": false,
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": "off",
    "editor.tabCompletion": "onlySnippets"
  },
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  },
  "debug.internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart"
}
```

Key shortcuts to remember:

- `F5` starts debugging
- `Ctrl+F5` / `Cmd+F5` triggers hot reload
- `Ctrl+Shift+F5` performs a hot restart
- `Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.` opens quick-fix actions for wrapping or extracting widgets.

Creating a new project is done through the Command Palette:
`Flutter: New Project` → select Application → choose directory → enter name.

## Reading `flutter doctor` output and fixing what's broken

Run `flutter doctor -v` (verbose mode) after completing setup. The command
checks eight categories: Flutter SDK, Android toolchain, Xcode (macOS only),
Chrome, Android Studio, VS Code, connected devices, and network resources. Each
line is prefixed with one of three symbols:

| Symbol  | Meaning | Action needed                                     |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **[✓]** | Passed  | None                                              |
| **[!]** | Warning | May need attention; development often still works |
| **[✗]** | Error   | Must fix before building for that platform        |

A fully healthy macOS output looks like:

```

The most frequently encountered errors and their fixes:

- **`flutter: command not found`**, Flutter is not in PATH. Re-add the
  `export PATH=...` line to the correct shell config file (`~/.zshrc`,
  `~/.bashrc`, or Windows Environment Variables) and restart your terminal.
- **`cmdline-tools component is missing`**, Open Android Studio → Tools → SDK
  Manager → SDK Tools tab → check "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)" →
  Apply.
- **`Android license status unknown`**, Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
  and accept each license with `y`.
- **`Unable to find bundled Java version`**, Newer Android Studio versions
  renamed the `jre` directory to `jbr`. On macOS, create a symlink:
  `cd "/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents" && ln -s jbr jre`. This issue
  is resolved in recent Flutter+Android Studio combinations, but persists if
  either is outdated.
- **CocoaPods failures on Apple Silicon**, Ensure you're using Homebrew Ruby,
  not system Ruby. Run `which ruby`, it should show
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby`, not `/usr/bin/ruby`. Reinstall CocoaPods
  via `brew install cocoapods` if needed.
- **Lock file errors during `pub get`**, Run `flutter clean`, then
  `flutter pub cache repair`, then `flutter pub get`. If persistent, delete
  `pubspec.lock` and retry.
- **"No devices available"**, Either no emulator is running, no physical device
  is connected, or platform support isn't enabled. Start an emulator from
  Android Studio's Device Manager or run `flutter emulators --launch` with an
  available emulator name.

## Conclusion

The 2026 Flutter installation process has matured significantly, the VS Code
quick-install path now handles SDK download and PATH configuration in one step,
and Swift Package Manager offers a welcome alternative to the historically
fragile CocoaPods dependency chain.

Three setup decisions matter most for production teams: choosing Homebrew on
macOS (it handles architecture differences automatically), installing Android
SDK Command-line Tools explicitly via SDK Manager (the universal failure point
that no wizard handles automatically), and integrating Shorebird from project
inception rather than retrofitting it under deadline pressure.

To confirm everything works, run `flutter doctor -v` and `shorebird doctor`
after every installation step. If both report no issues, your environment is
production-ready.

---

## Next Steps

Now that your Flutter environment is properly configured, here are strategic
next steps based on your project needs:

**For production deployment planning**: Explore
[Shorebird's code push system architecture](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/system-architecture/)
to understand how over-the-air updates work at a technical level, then review
[update strategies](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/update-strategies/) to
determine when patches download and apply in your app's lifecycle.

**For team collaboration**: Set up
[organizations in Shorebird](https://docs.shorebird.dev/account/orgs/) to manage
team access and permissions, and integrate with your
[CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/ci/github/),
[Codemagic](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/ci/codemagic/), or
[generic CI systems](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/ci/generic/).

**For security-conscious environments**: Review
[patch signing](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/patch-signing/) to
cryptographically verify patch authenticity, understand
[Shorebird's security model](https://docs.shorebird.dev/system/security/), and
learn about
[obfuscation and security tooling integration](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/security-tools/).

**For staged rollouts**: Implement
[percentage-based rollouts](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/percentage-based-rollouts/)
to gradually deploy patches to user segments, set up
[staging patches](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/staging-patches/)
for internal testing, and understand
[patch rollback procedures](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/rollback/) for
emergency scenarios.

**For multi-flavor apps**: Configure
[Android flavors](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/flavors/android/)
and
[iOS/macOS flavors](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/guides/flavors/ios/) to
manage separate development, staging, and production builds with independent
patch tracks.
