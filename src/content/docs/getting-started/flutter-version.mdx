Shorebird works with a wide range of Flutter versions and uses a private cache
of Flutter installs which it will automatically manage for you to match your
desired Flutter version.

When Shorebird CLI is installed, it pulls down the latest stable version of
Shorebird's Flutter. In this section, we'll take a look at how to list and
change the Flutter version used by Shorebird CLI.

## Supported Flutter Versions

| Platform | Minimum Flutter Version | Minimum Shorebird Version |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Android  | 3.10.0                  | 1.2.0                     |
| iOS      | 3.24.0                  | 1.2.0                     |
| MacOS    | 3.27.3                  | 1.6.17                    |
| Windows  | 3.32.6                  | 1.6.17                    |
| Linux    | 3.29.0                  | 1.6.17                    |

Shorebird recommends using the latest stable version of Flutter whenever
possible. When we make changes to Shorebird we do not currently backport those
changes to previous releases of Flutter.

## List Flutter Versions

To list all Flutter versions Shorebird has published, use the
`shorebird flutter versions list` command.

The Flutter version used by `shorebird release` by default is marked with a `âœ“`.

:::tip

Another way to see the current Flutter version is by running
`shorebird --version`.

:::

## Use a Different Flutter Version

By default, Shorebird will use the latest stable version of Flutter. If you need
to create a release with a different version of Flutter, you can use the
`--flutter-version` option with the `shorebird release` command:

```sh
shorebird release android --flutter-version=3.10.6
```

Any patches created with this release will be built with the version of Flutter
used by the release.

:::note

Only the release command supports the `--flutter-version` option. Patches will
always be built with the version of Flutter used by the release.

## Flutter Version Notes

To help you avoid hidden pitfalls, we maintain version notes on Flutter releases
that have known issues affecting releasing apps or patching. Check here before
upgrading or deploying.

- April 8, 2024: We have disabled releasing new versions for iOS on Flutter
  versions 3.10.6 - 3.19.4 due to various crashes found in previous iOS
  releases. Patching continues to be supported.
- June, 11, 2024: We have disabled releasing and patching for iOS on Flutter
  versions 3.19.5 - 3.22.1 due to a bug where "try/catch" clauses would not
  always run the "catch" block after an exception was thrown. This bug only
  affected iOS apps after patching.
- August 2025: There is a potential crash bug present in all versions of Flutter
  3.11.x to 3.29.1, when using "async" ffi calls (via NativeCallable). The crash
  was identified in spring of 2025 when package:ffigen (the package used to
  generate ffi calls) changed its default behavior to use NativeCallable. We
  recommend all apps use Flutter 3.29.1 or later if possible or carefully
  control their dependencies to avoid using recent versions of ffigen or
  packages generated with ffigen.
- August 26, 2025: Shorebird has skipped support for 3.35.0 and 3.35.1 and have
  fast forwarded to 3.35.2. If your using the 3.35.x release please ensure your
  using at least 3.35.2.
