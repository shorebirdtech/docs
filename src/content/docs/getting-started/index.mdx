Welcome to Shorebird! ðŸ‘‹

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through setting up Shorebird and integrating it
into your app in just a few minutes.

## Sign up

The first thing you'll need to do is sign up for a Shorebird account. It's free
to do and you can signup in a manner of seconds.

To create an account, head over to our
[Web Console](https://console.shorebird.dev) and authenticate with one of the
available authentication methods.

## Install

While a full install may not be required to access and use all of our product
offerings, we recommend installing everything locally to make debugging easier
as you continue using our services.

### Using install script

To install the Shorebird command line interface (CLI):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maclinux" label="Mac/Linux" default>

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Needed to execute remote scripts
iwr -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.ps1'|iex
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

Installing Shorebird CLI requires `git`.

:::

This installs `shorebird` into `~/.shorebird/bin` and adds it to your `PATH`. It
also installs a copy of Flutter and Dart inside
`~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`. The copy of Flutter is slightly modified to
add Shorebird code push and is not intended to be added to your `PATH`. You can
continue to use the versions of Flutter and Dart you already have installed.

### Manually installing

Shorebird can also be manually installed, allowing users to choose where the
installation will be placed.

In order to do so, in a terminal, inside the folder where Shorebird should be
installed at, run:

```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird.git
```

Add the `bin` folder from the repository you just cloned into your `PATH`.

:::note

The total installation is about 300mb.

:::

Once the installation has completed, `shorebird` should be available in your
terminal:

```
$ shorebird

```
$ shorebird doctor

Finally, you can log in to your Shorebird account on your machine:

```sh
shorebird login
```

## Integrate Shorebird

Your now ready to add Shorebird to your app.

You can start by creating a new Flutter app or navigating to the directory of
your already created Flutter app.

```sh
flutter create my_shorebird_app
cd my_shorebird_app
```

To enable this app for Shorebird just run:

```sh
shorebird init
```

This will create a `shorebird.yaml` file in the root of your project. This file
contains your Shorebird `app_id`. Your `app_id` is not secret and can be checked
into source control and freely shared.

This will also run `shorebird doctor` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

:::note

Shorebird expects to find the latest stable `flutter` installed on your machine.
Shorebird can be configured to work with older versions of Flutter (back to
3.10.0). See [Flutter Version Management](/getting-started/flutter-version) for
more info.
