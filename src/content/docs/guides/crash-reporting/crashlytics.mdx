If you're using Crashlytics for crash reporting, it will work out-of-the-box
with Shorebird releases and patches. However, if you have multiple patches, it
can be unclear which patch caused the crash. This document shows how you can use
Crashlytics TODO to differentiate between patches.

## Add the `shorebird_code_push` package to your project.

[shorebird_code_push](https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push) is available
on pub.dev and lets you programmatically determine your app's current patch
number. To add it to your project, follow the instructions on the package's
pub.dev page.

## Configure Crashlytics
