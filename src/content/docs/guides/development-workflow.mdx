This guide will walk through an opinionated development workflow with Shorebird.
We'll cover how to automate releasing and patching with Shorebird to streamline
the development process.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are already familiar with Shorebird and have integrated
it into your application. Refer to the [getting started](/) instructions for
more information.

## Overview

Shorebird provides a set of tools that you can use to push over the air updates
to your customers but it's up to you to decide how to integrate it into your
development workflow.

While there are many ways to integrate Shorebird, the following workflow is a
common approach that we recommend:

![development-workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59eaefc4-1213-4549-b0d6-38738b065147)

The illustration above, uses [trunk based
development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) and tags to trigger automated
release and patch workflows.

The workflow consists of three main phases:

1. **Development**: Developers work on features and bug fixes.
1. **Release**: When a feature is ready, a release is created and distributed to
   customers (typically via stores).
1. **Patch**: If a critical bug is found, a patch is created and distributed to
   customers immediately via Shorebird.

Let's walk through each phase in more detail.

## Development

Most of the time is spent in the development phase. During this phase,
developers are building features and fixing bugs.

The development workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Create branch from trunk (main)
1. Work on task
1. Open a pull request to merge changes into trunk
1. Squash and merge after ci checks & code review

Note that with the described workflow, the trunk (e.g. main) is always in a
releasable state. This puts pressure on continuous integration (CI) checks to ensure
that the code on the trunk is always in a healthy, deployable state. Checks that would
typically run as part of the continuous integration process include:

- Linting
- Formatting
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Test coverage reports

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

## Release

When the team is ready to distribute a new version of the app, a release is
created. In some cases, releases are created on a regular cadence (e.g. weekly,
bi-weekly, monthly) while in other cases, releases are created on an ad-hoc
basis.

The release workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Create a release branch (e.g release/v1.0.0) from trunk (main)
1. Tag the commit (e.g v1.0.0)
1. The release workflow is triggered and generates signed artifacts
1. Distribute the artifacts (e.g. via AppStore, PlayStore, etc.)

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

<RemoteCode
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/flutter_and_friends/refs/heads/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml"
  title=".github/workflows/release.yaml"
/>

When the release workflow has finished running, the artifacts are ready to be
distributed to customers via the appropriate channels (e.g. AppStore, PlayStore,
etc.).

## Patch

Sometimes, despite lots testing, critical bugs can creep into the app. Shorebird
allows you to fix these bugs and distribute the patches to customers devices
immediately rather having to wait for releases to be approved and distributed.

The patch workflow can be broken down into the follow steps:

1. Apply the hotfix to the trunk (identical to the development workflow above)
   1. Create a branch from trunk (main)
   1. Fix the bug
   1. Open a pull request to merge changes into trunk
   1. Squash and merge after ci checks & code review
1. Cherry pick the commit into the desired release branch(es)
1. Tag the commit using -hotfix.x (e.g v1.0.0-hotfix.1)
1. The patch workflow is triggered and uploads the hotfix to the staging environment
1. Preview the release in the staging environment & validate the fix
1. Promote the hotfix to production

You can refer to the following GitHub Actions workflow for an example.

<RemoteCode
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/flutter_and_friends/refs/heads/main/.github/workflows/patch.yaml"
  title=".github/workflows/patch.yaml"
/>

When the patch workflow has finished running, the hotfix is ready to be
validated in [Shorebird's staging environment](/guides/staging-patches) and
promoted to production.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we took a look at an opinionated development workflow with
Shorebird which allows teams to automate releasing and patching in order to
iterate quickly while still delivering a high quality experience to customers.
