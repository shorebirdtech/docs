We recommend that you test your patches with a subset of users before
distributing to all users.

Shorebird’s mechanism to release to a subset of users is “tracks”. By
convention the “stable” track is distributed to all users of your app by
default. When you make a patch “live” it goes to “stable” and all users will
update to that patch.

Today Shorebird supports “staging”, “beta” and “stable” tracks:
https://pub.dev/documentation/shorebird_code_push/latest/shorebird_code_push/UpdateTrack.html
We have plans to [allow additional track names in the future](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater/issues/255).

Typically we se customers use "staging" for internal testing (on developers'
machines) and "beta" for wider group testing (e.g. QA teams where `shorebird`
commands are not available).

As part of our privacy stance, we _never_ know anything about your users, so
we have no way to tell users apart or to specify which users should receive
a patch from within our product. However, we do provide you mechanisms for
controlling updates via Shorebird with user information you have access to
from within your company and your application. See the
[Percentage Based Rollouts guide](/guides/percentage-based-rollouts) for examples.

We recommend using one of the following three approaches to distribute patches to a subset of
users (e.g. your QA team) for testing without affecting your public users in
production.

All of these options require disabling auto_update support, and using
[package:shorebird_code_push](https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push) for
more advanced control over the update process.

### Option 1: Hidden UI to switch tracks

If your app does not have a login/user-account mechanism, this is your best
option. If it does, we recommend option 2.

Some stores discourage hidden UIs; however our customers tell us it is common
practice. For example, some apps may
enable a “QA” mode in their app after a certain series of clicks or special
gestures, etc., similar to how Android enables developer mode when [tapping 7 times
on the Android version text in the settings app](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
From a QA mode, you could allow testers to switch to the “beta”
patch track, even from your production app. They could similarly switch back to
“stable” to move back to what production users see today.

### Option 2: Control Shorebird track based on the current user’s account.

If your app has a login mechanism, this is your best option. If it does not, we
recommend option 1.

Once your user has logged in, you determine whether the user is a tester
and then change your Shorebird update code to use that information
when updating, e.g.

```dart
final track = user.isTester ? UpdateTrack.beta : UpdateTrack.stable;
shorebirdUpdater.update(track: track);
```

### Option 3: Control Shorebird Track based on how the app was installed.

Other companies provide existing mechanisms for testing mobile apps before
production. Apple TestFlight, Google Release Tracks, Firebase App Distribution
are all examples of this. Shorebird does not have built-in detection of these
distribution mechanisms, but it is typically possible to detect the mechanism
via which an App was installed on the user’s device.

It is then possible to pick the Shorebird track based on the detected install mechanism,
allowing you to thus distribute patches _only_ to your TestFlight users, etc.

Because detection of install mechanisms can be unreliable, we recommend option 1
or 2 for most teams, but include this option for completeness. Most teams who
distribute via TestFlight, for example, also have QA-specific accounts and thus
option 2 is strictly better.
