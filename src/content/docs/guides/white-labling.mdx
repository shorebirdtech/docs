This is a placeholder article. We seem to have many customers using Shorebird
within a white labeling environment, but we have little personal experience
with white labeling and love to work with someone to update this document
to include your best practices.

Shorebird can also be used to send the same patch to multiple apps.

"White labeling" is a practice one sells the same product (in this case,
application) to multiple customers, with small per-customer tweaks. This is a
common practice for app development, for example you might sell an app to local
gyms that allows them to reach their subscribers, handle class scheduling, etc.
all with their own branding. You can of course then sell the same app to
another gym, just submit it to the stores with a different name, icon and maybe
a few other changes.

Submitting the same app update to 1000 apps in the store is something that
Shorebird can help with, since updates through Shorebird can be completely
automated (which is not always true of the stores). Your agreements with the
stores still apply and you should make sure you're still complying with such of
course.

There are different methods for white-labeling applications, Shorebird
currently does not offer any automation tooling for any specific method, however
it should be straightforward to build on top of what we do offer.

For example, imagine you use per-customer flavors. You could imagine doing
something like this:

1. Make the code change to the dart code.

2. For each application, submit a patch:

`shorebird patch android --flavor customer1`

The above could be turned into a script, or integrated with your existing
per-customer automation.
