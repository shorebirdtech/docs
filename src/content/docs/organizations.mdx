Shorebird free "Hobby" users can upgrade to the Pro tier to add these features
via the account settings page in the [Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev/account).

## Upgrading to Pro

You can manage your account and billing at any time via
https://console.shorebird.dev/account

There is an "Edit" drop-down there, and from within that an "Upgrade Account"
option which will present you a pop-up dialog and allow you to upgrade to the "Pro" plan.

If you do not see the plan you're expecting, please reach out to
contact@shorebird.dev we'd be happy to work with you.

Once you've upgraded to the Pro plan, you have the ability to use the above
features.

## Creating an Organization

Organizations are a way share groups of apps with groups of people. To create an
organization, visit the Shorebird console and click the account dropdown in the
top left corner. From there, click the "+" button next to "Organizations".

This will automatically create a new organization called "My Organization". You
can head over to the organization's settings to change the name:

## Managing Organization Members

To add one or more members to your organization, visit the organization's
settings and click the "Add member" button.

You can also edit a member's role or remove them from the organization from the
same organization settings page.

## Managing Organization Apps

Organizations can have multiple apps associated with them. You can either
transfer existing apps to an organization or create new apps within the
organization directly.

To transfer an existing app to an organization, visit the app's settings and
click the "Transfer app" button. You can then select the organization you want
to transfer the app to from the dropdown.

To create a new app within an organization, select the organization when running
`shorebird init`:

## Organization Roles

Organization roles apply to all apps within the organization and can be managed
via the organization settings page in the Shorebird console.

If you have any questions about access control for your app, please do not
hesitate to reach out to contact@shorebird.dev.

### Organization Member

New members added to an organization are assigned the "Member" role by default.

Members can:

- Read information for all apps within the organization
- View collaborators on all apps within the organization
- Create releases and patches for all apps within the organization
- View insights for all apps within the organization

### Organization Admin

Organization Admins can:

- Do everything a Member can do
- Add and Remove Members for the organization
- Delete Apps within the organization
- Delete Releases within the organization

### Organization Owner

There is only one owner per organization (the person who created the
organization) and they have full control over the organization and all apps
within it.

The owner can:

- Do everything an Admin can do
- Manage the billing information for the organization

## Managing Collaborators

Per app collaborators can also be added and managed via the Shorebird console.
To add a collaborator, from your app's page:

1. Select the "Collaborators" tab.
2. Click "Add people".
3. Enter the email address of the person you would like to add as a
   collaborator.
   1. Note that the email address must be associated with an existing Shorebird
      account.
4. Click "Add Collaborator".

Existing collaborators can be removed by clicking the trash icon next to their
email address.

## Collaborator Roles

_Roles are per-app._ Each account can create Apps tied to that account. Once an
App is created, access to that app can be shared. If you have any questions
about access control for your app, please do not hesitate to reach out to
contact@shorebird.dev.

### App Developer

The Developer role can:

- Read information for a single app
- View collaborators on that app
- Create releases and patches for that app
- View insights for that app

Developers can be added and removed by any Admin, see below.

### App Admin

The Admin role can:

- Do everything a Developer can do
- Add and Remove Developers for an App
- Delete Apps
- Delete Releases Admin permissions cannot currently be modified in the console.
  Please email us if you need to add/remove Admins from an app.

## Transferring Ownership

The easiest way to transfer app ownership is to have the desired owner create an
organization and add the current owner to the organization. The current owner
can then transfer the app to the organization.
