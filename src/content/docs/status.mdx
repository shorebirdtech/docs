There are no known major issues with Shorebird on iOS or Android.

Issues affecting some customers:
* `--obfuscate` does not work with iOS builds on Shorebird.
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1619
* Would like to share groups of apps with my company: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/739 (For now, can help you do this via our support email see https://docs.shorebird.dev/teams/).
