Shorebird Teams tier and higher allows adding an unlimited number of
collaborators to an app. Shorebird free "Hobby" users can upgrade
to the Teams tier to add collaborators via a link in the
[Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev).

## Managing Collaborators

Collaborators can be managed on the Shorebird console. To add a collaborator,
from your app's page:

1. Select the "Collaborators" tab.
2. Click "Add people".
3. Enter the email address of the person you would like to add as a collaborator.
   1. Note that the email address must be associated with an existing Shorebird account.
4. Click "Add Collaborator".

Existing collaborators can be removed by clicking the trash icon next to their
email address.

## App Roles

_Roles are per-app._ Each account can create Apps tied to that account. Once an
App is created, access to that app can be shared. If you have any questions
about access control for your app, please do not hesitate to reach out to
contact@shorebird.dev.

### App Developer

The Developer role can:

- Read information for a single app
- View collaborators on that app
- Create releases and patches for that app
- View insights for that app

Developers can be added and removed by any Admin, see below.

### App Admin

The Admin role can:

- Everything a Developer can do
- Add and Remove Developers for an App
- Delete Apps
- Delete Releases
  Admin permissions cannot currently be modified in the console. Please email us
  if you need to add/remove Admins from an app.

## Account Owner

Only the account owner can create apps tied to that account or change the
billing information for that account. When an App is created it is tied to an
Owner account. Individual Apps can be moved between accounts (have their
Owner changed) by contacting us at contact@shorebird.dev.

## Sharing Multiple Apps

Each app maintains a separate list of collaborators. If you need to share
multiple apps with a team, you will need to add each app separately. We plan
to add more robust teams support later this year.

## Transferring Ownership

We do not currently have an automated way to transfer ownership of an app.
However you're welcome to [contact us](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev) and we
will be happy to help you transfer ownership of an app.

# FAQ

## Another person purchased Shorebird, but they want me to create the apps?

Shorebird currently only has app-level sharing, rather than account-level sharing
so it's not possible to set up billing for a "group" of users, but when an app
is created it is associated with an "owner" account, to which installs are billed.
We plan to add account-level sharing later this year:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/739

To create apps which are billed to someone else, there are 3 options:

1. If this person is able to create the apps (run `shorebird init` in the
   codebase), then those apps will then be associated with their account and
   they can set per-app permissions accordingly, as per the above instructions.

2. It's possible for us to manually associate their Stripe Customer with your
   account, so that you can create and administer access to apps but have the
   billing sent to their Stripe account. This is probably the most common
   solution we've deployed. This allows you to create as many apps now or in the
   future without needing the card holder to take further action.

3. It is also possible for you to create any needed apps and then afterwards, we
   can then transfer the apps to their account for them to manage, including
   giving you "Admin" if desired. This means any time you'd like to create
   another app billed to their account you'll need to reach out to
   contact@shorebird.dev, but it's very quick for us to move apps when needed.

For either option 2 or 3, please reach out to contact@shorebird.dev and
tell us which option you would like to pursue and the email addresses associated
with the accounts, and we would be _happy_ to help. Please make sure that all
email addresses involved already have Shorebird accounts (accounts are created when logging into https://console.shorebird.dev/ for the first time).

We are aware that this is a common source confusion due to our limited sharing support at this time
and we expect to have it addressed with a more sophisticated app sharing system
later this year: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/739
